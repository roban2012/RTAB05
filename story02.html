	<hr><br>
	
2-Sep-14	<br><br>
By Evan Osnos	<br><br>
	
In the summer of 1996, the Chinese Communist Party erected a giant digital clock, fifty feet tall and thirty feet long, beside Tiananmen Square, which counted down the seconds until, as it said in large characters across the top, “The Chinese Government Regains Sovereignty Over Hong Kong.” After a century and a half under British colonial rule, Hong Kong’s restoration, in 1997, was a hugely symbolic moment for China’s national identity, an end to a history of invasion in which, as the Chinese put it, their land was “cut up like a melon” by foreign powers.	<br><br>
	
Under a deal brokered with the British, China agreed not to alter Hong Kong’s internationalized way of life―including freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and other political rights not permitted on the mainland―for half a century. The theory was that, as mainland China continued to climb out of the poverty and political instability of the past, its leaders would gradually allow more political openness on the mainland. After a half century, or so the thinking went, the gap between the mainland and its reunited territory would have narrowed so much that they could mesh without much difficulty.	<br><br>

<a href= "link03.html">咀嚼《罗马史》</a><br><br>

	
	
	
But, after nearly two decades, things are turning out differently. On Sunday, the Beijing government rejected demands for free, open elections for Hong Kong’s next chief executive, in 2017, enraging protesters who had called for broad rights to nominate candidates. China’s National People’s Congress announced a plan by which nominees must be vetted and approved by more than fifty per cent of a committee that is likely to be stacked with those who heed Beijing’s wishes. If that plan comes to pass, opposition figures who favor more democracy have little chance of making it onto the ballot. (As Boss Tweed liked to say, “I don’t care who does the electing, so long as I get to do the nominating.”)	<br><br>
	
The crisis, which will likely grow, is proving to be a test not only of Hong Kong’s political culture but also of which political ethic will prevail across China in the years ahead: globalism or nationalism, two fundamentally different conceptions of how China will relate to the rest of the world. Hong Kong takes pride in its role as Asia’s original global city, a cultural and political mashup with a raucous, multilingual press corps and hot and noisy local politics―a largely borderless world of money, people, and ideas. Its courts rely on English common law, which is, in theory, free from political influence.	<br><br>
	
But, on the mainland, even as China’s economy has continued to grow and its population has become more integrated with the world, leaders have set new limits on political liberalization. They have concluded that greater democracy would threaten political stability and sovereignty, and they believe that China must instead adhere to its own centralized, one-party model. Last summer, as the scholar Sebastian Veg described, the Party circulated an internal directive to members that singled out seven “do not mention” topics: “democracy, universal values, civil society, market liberalism, media independence, criticizing errors in the history of the Party (‘historical nihilism’), and questioning the policy of opening up and reforms and the socialist nature of the regime.”	<br><br>
	
Hong Kong’s growing activist network, known as Occupy Central (named after the city’s downtown) has increasingly alarmed leaders in Beijing, and they now describe the activism as a brush fire that could sweep over the mainland. In a piece published on Saturday, the People’s Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, hinted about foreign agitators “attempting to turn Hong Kong into a bridgehead for subverting and infiltrating the Chinese mainland. This can absolutely not be permitted.”	<br><br>
	
In theory, China’s President, Xi Jinping, could have sought a middle road that would have opened up the nominating process enough to produce a competitive election. But, when the protests began earlier this year, Beijing worried that backing down would embolden further acts of resistance, not only in Hong Kong but also on the mainland. “If we yield because some people threaten to commence radical, illegal activities, it would only result in more, bigger illegal activities,” Li Fei, a mainland official, told Hong Kong lawmakers.	<br><br>
	
That is a strategy that points toward confrontation. Beijing chose the safer, short-term solution, but it left in place the ingredients for growing tension. Benny Tai, a law professor and opposition leader, said that the announcement opened a new “era of resistance.” “Today is not only the darkest day in the history of Hong Kong’s democratic development,” he told reporters. “Today is also the darkest day of one country, two systems,” a reference to the relationship between Hong Kong and the government in Beijing.	<br><br>
	
The most important questions are now up to the opposition: How far will pro-democracy activists go? Historically, Hong Kong’s political culture is loud and demonstrative, but not violent. The protesters have vowed to block Hong Kong’s financial district, in order to bring it to a standstill. But will it be a symbolic effort or a functional attempt to force a confrontation?	<br><br>
	
	

	
In turn, how will the Beijing-backed local government respond? Not long ago, it would have been unthinkable to imagine People’s Liberation Army vehicles on the streets of Hong Kong, but in the past quarter century the Party has shown that it is prepared to take whatever steps it deems necessary to tamp down public protests. On Sunday, hundreds of local police, and dozens of their vehicles, were arrayed around Hong Kong’s government headquarters. Last week, at least four P.L.A. armored personnel carriers were spotted in the streets.	<br><br>
	
Most important, if the confrontation becomes more acute, how will Hong Kong’s largely moderate middle class respond? So far, it has provided ambivalent support for the Occupy Central movement, fearing that unrest, even for popular ideas, could undermine the city’s business climate or invite harsher measures from Beijing. But how many of Hong Kong’s citizens will see a show of force as a reason to back down, and how many will see it as a reason to join the more radical pro-democracy camp?	<br><br>
	
The struggle over political values at the center of this crisis runs much deeper than the technical debate over Hong Kong’s elections. It is likely to get worse before it gets better. In a statement on Sunday, the Occupy Central activists described a sense of desperation, a belief that “all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen.” It did not say when that occupation will begin.	<br><br>

Hillary Inevitable? Fading Book Sales Say No	<br><br>
<a href= "link07.html">希拉里和奥巴马的导师</a><br><br>
<a href= "link08.html">阿林斯基（Saul D. Alinsky）</a><br><br>
 	
	
 Posted:07/02/201407/02/2014 	<br><br>
	
 WASHINGTON -- If books can make presidencies -- and Barack Obama proved they can-- then hold the talk about the inevitability of Hillary Clinton.	<br><br>
	
The Huffington Post has learned that new survey figures show sales of her foreign policy memoir, Hard Choices, are falling fast.	<br><br>
	
According to authoritative numbers from Bookscan, which monitors sales at 80 percent of bookstores nationwide, retail sales of Hard Choices plummeted another 50 percent in the third week -- down to 26,190 from 48,200 the week before and 85,900 the first week of publication.	<br><br>
	
Books whose sales drop off by half in successive weeks generally don't become blockbusters, which could be a problem -- a big one -- for Clinton's publisher, Simon & Schuster.	<br><br>
	
S&S reportedly shipped 1 million copies of the book to stores and is said to have paid Clinton an advance approaching $14 million. At the current rate, it would take many months to sell the million copies -- an unlikely prospect according to industry sources.	<br><br>
	
It looks like they are going to be pulping a lot of paper, said a top industry source, who declined to be quoted by name because of the sensitivity of the matter in the industry. A Simon & Schuster spokesman declined immediate comment.	<br><br>
	
By comparison, Clinton's 2003 book, Living History, sold six times as many volumes in its first week and eventually 1.4 million worldwide in hardback. Obama's Dreams From My Father had sold 4.65 million in hardback, paperback and ebook as of 2010.	<br><br>
	
Bookscan figures do not count ebooks, but industry sources suggest that most sales of Clinton's book are likely to be hard copies because of the keepsake, for-the-fans nature of such memoirs.	<br><br>
	
Explanations for the rapidly weakening sales range from the antiseptic cover picture to the edge-of-summer timing. Clinton supporters in the publishing industry say that times have changed for all authors and that nonfiction books of the kind she (and Obama) wrote are not as popular as they once were. They also note that Hard Choices is doing well on a comparative basis, outselling most other nonfiction titles. 	<br><br>
	
But the more urgent question is political. 	<br><br>
	
The sales figures come out amid a war of competing conventional wisdoms, fervently held by pundits and pols.	<br><br>
	
One says that Hillary is inevitable, that Obama-like lightning can’t strike twice, and that she has sewn up the allegiance of the left with no significant figures on the horizon to challenge her for the nomination -- or even the presidency in the 2016 general election. The New Republic, for example, put her on the cover with the word "Inevitable" just this week.	<br><br>
	
The other conventional wisdom is just as sure that Clinton is now, as she was in 2008, a heavier-than-air craft. She will never achieve lift-off because she is too establishment, too controlled, too weighed down by her years of association with the rich and powerful -- and too lacking in a clear message of change for younger generations. The rocky rollout of her book tour is evidence of the latter, they say.	<br><br>
	
At the very least, the book sales seem to confirm the observations of Bill Maher, who advised Clinton to "just go away."	<br><br>
	
People say Hillary being out there on her book tour, talking about this stuff, it's going to inoculate her, said Maher, the host of HBO's "Real Time." "You know there's a fine line between inoculate and we're sick of you. So my advice to Hillary is, just go away. Go away for a while. We're going to see each other. In a couple of years, a lot. Just go away. Because otherwise you're going to blow this."	<br><br>

Angels and Demons by Dan Brown<br><br>
	
Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca: To the Illuminati睿智的人 先觉者/光照派, and to those of science, let me say this. You have won the war. (Manichean /摩尼教 &《倚天屠龙记》& 任我行)<br><br>
The wheels have been in motion for a long time. Your victory has been inevitable. Never before has it been as obvious as it is at this moment. Science is the new god. (Kojève & Leo Strauss)<br><br>
Medicine, electronic communications, space travel, genetic manipulation (Biotech)… these are the miracles about which we now tell our children. These are the miracles we herald as proof that science will bring us the answers. The ancient stories of immaculate洁净\精确conceptions, burning bushes, and parting seas are no longer relevant. God has become obsolete废弃\过时. Science has won the battle. We concede承认. <br><br>
But science’s victory has cost every one of us. And it has cost us deeply. (Interstellar, Nolan & Thorne)<br><br>
Science may have alleviated 减轻 / the miseries of disease and drudgery辛苦工作 / and provided an array of gadgetry小器具/for our entertainment and convenience, but is has left us in a world without wonder. Our sunsets have been reduced to wavelengths and frequencies. The complexities of the universe have been shredded碎片 into mathematical equations. Even our self-worth as human beings has been destroyed. Science proclaims that Planet Earth and its inhabitants are a meaningless speck污点/微粒in the grand scheme. A cosmic accident. Even the technology that promises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now electronically connected to the globe, and yet we feel utterly alone. We are bombarded with violence, division, fracture破碎/断裂, and betrayal. Skepticism has become a virtue. Cynicism讥讽/愤世嫉俗/玩世不恭/犬儒主义/and demand for proof has become enlightened thought. Is it any wonder that humans now feel more depressed and defeated than they have at any point in human history? Does science hold anything sacred宗教的/神圣的? Science looks for answers by probing our unborn fetuses胎儿 /. Science even presumes to rearrange our own DNA. It shatters God’s world into smaller and smaller pieces in quest of meaning… and all it finds is more questions. <br><br>（The most dangerous enemy is that which no one fears!）<br><br>
The ancient war between science and religion is over. You have won. But you have not won fairly. You have not won by providing answers. You have won by so radically reorienting our society that the truths we once saw as signposts now seem inapplicable. Religion cannot keep up. Scientific growth is exponential指数增长. It feeds on itself like a virus. Every new breakthrough opens doors for new breakthroughs. Mankind took thousands of years to progress from the wheel to the car. Yet only decades from the car into space. Now we measure scientific progress in weeks. We are spinning out of control. The rift裂缝between us grows deeper and deeper, and as religion is left behind, people find themselves in a spiritual void. We cry out for meaning. And believe me, we do cry out. We see UFOs, engage in channeling, spirit contact, out-of-body experiences, mindquests ― all these eccentric古怪/异常ideas (heresy/evil cult) have a scientific veneer饰面/ 虚饰, but they are unashamedly irrational. They are the desperate cry of the modern soul, lonely and tormented, crippled跛/瘸/残疾 by its own enlightenment and its inability to accept meaning in anything removed from technology. (Wired)<br><br>
Science (Democracy), you say, will save us. Science, I say, has destroyed us. Since the days of Galileo, the church has tried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with misguided means, but always with benevolent好心肠 慈善intention. Even so, the temptations 诱惑are too great for man to resist. I warn you, look around yourselves. The promises of science have not been kept. Promises of efficiency and simplicity have bred nothing but pollution and chaos. We are a fractured折断/破碎 and frantic发疯似/发狂/厉害species… moving down a path of destruction. (An die Freude/Ode to Joy & We are the world, 观想)<br><br>
Who is this God science? Who is the God who offers his people power but no moral framework to tell you how to use that power? What kind of God gives a child fire but does not warn the child of its dangers? The language of science comes with no signposts about good and bad. Science textbooks tell us how to create a nuclear reaction, and yet they contain no chapter asking us if it is a good or a bad idea. (Navigation/Wandern)<br><br>
To science, I say this. The church is tired. We are exhausted from trying to be your sign posts. Our resources are drying up from our campaign to be the voice of balance as you plow犁耕/费力穿过blindly on in your quest for smaller chips and larger profits. We ask not why you will not govern yourselves, but how can you? Your world moves so fast that if you stop even for an instant to consider the implications of your actions, someone more efficient will whip past you in a blur. So you move on. You proliferate weapons of mass destruction, but it is the Pope who travels the world beseeching恳求/乞求 leaders to use restraint克制. You clone living creatures, but it is the church reminding us to consider the moral implications of our actions. You encourage people to interact on phones, TVs, computers, and Internet, but it is the church who opens its doors and reminds us to commune in person as we were meant to do. You even murder unborn babies in the name of research that will save lives. Again, it is the church who points the fallacy谬误 错误of that reasoning.<br><br>
And all the while, you proclaim the church is ignorant无知/愚昧. But who is more ignorant? The man who cannot define lightning, or the man who does not respect its awesome power? This church is reaching out to you. Reaching out to everyone. And yet the more we reach, the more you push us away. Show me proof there is a God, you say. I say use your telescopes to look to the heavens, and tell me how there could not be a God! You ask what does God look like. I say, where does that question come from? The answers are one and the same. Do you not see God in you science? How can you miss Him! You proclaim that even the slightest change in the force of gravity or the weight of an atom would have rendered提出/放弃/让与/归还 our universe a lifeless mist rather than our magnificent sea of heavenly bodies, and yet you fail to see God’s hand in this? Is it really so much easier to believe that we simply chose the right card from a deck of billions? Have we become so spiritually bankrupt that we would rather believe in mathematical impossibility than in a power greater than us? <br><br>
Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this. When we as a species abandon our trust in the power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability责任. Faith… all faiths… are admonitions 告诫 /劝告that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable… With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. If the outside world could see this church as I do… looking beyond the ritual of these walls… they would see a modern miracle… a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion怜悯/ 同情/恻隐之心in a world spinning out of control. (Maniac/Mutant/Messiah)<br><br>
Are we obsolete废弃/过时/退化? Are these men dinosaurs? Am I? Does the world really need a voice for the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the unborn child? Do we really need souls like these who, though imperfect, spend their lives imploring恳求 each of us to read the signposts of morality and not lose our way?<br><br>
Tonight we are perched栖息 on a precipice悬崖. None of us can afford to be apathetic无感情/冷淡/无动于衷. Whether you see this evil as Satan, corruption, or immorality不道德/, the dark force is alive and growing every day. Do not ignore it. The force, though mighty, is not invincible无敌. Goodness can prevail. Listen to your hearts. Listen to God. Together we can step back from this abyss深渊/ 地狱.<br><br>

帮助丹・布朗的歌唱事业外，布莱丝最大的影响莫过于写作，她对丹・布朗的作品助益良多。他们曾用笔名合写过幽默小品，推测她应该也在其它作品里占有重要的角色。在《骗局》的铭谢页上，丹・布朗感谢“布莱丝・布朗，感谢她不辞辛劳为我研究背景、提作写作灵感”。	<br><br>
	
新英格兰老师	<br><br>
	
丹・布朗和布莱丝在1993年搬回家乡新罕布夏州，到他的母校菲利普艾斯特学院担任英语老师，并在林肯阿克曼小学，一所只有8个年级250名学生的小学校）教高年级学生西班牙语。	<br><br>
	
1994年，丹・布朗发行一张名为《天使与魔鬼》（Angels & Demons）的音乐CD，美术设计就是后来为同名小说设计双元式图标的约翰・兰登。唱片封面上，同样也有致妻子的感谢辞，“送给我孜孜不倦的合力撰稿者、合作制片人、副技师、其他重要的人，还有心理治疗师。”	<br><br>
	
也是同一年，他到大溪地渡假时，读完席尼・薛尔顿的《末日追杀》，他认为自己可以写得比他好。于是他开始起草撰写《数字城堡》，一边跟妻子用笔名丹妮儿・布朗（Danielle Brown）合写幽默小品《187种该躲开的男人：给情场失意女的指南》（187 Men to Avoid: A Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman），作者介绍写着，“丹妮儿・布朗现住新英格兰，教书写书躲男人。”著作权页还是列著丹・布朗的名字，这本书付印前就预售了上千本。	<br><br>
	
	
1996年，丹・布朗辞去教职全心投入写作。1998年出版《数字城堡》，布莱丝为这部小说作足了行销，她撰写新闻稿、为丹・布朗敲定谈话节目以及记者访谈。几个月后，丹・布朗和妻子又发表了另一本幽默小品《The Bald Book》，这部小品的作者正式属名为布莱丝，不过出版商说主要的撰写人还是丹・布朗。《天使与魔鬼》是第三本。	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 丹・布朗的前三部小说成绩平平，每部小说的初版大约只有万本，但是到了第四部小说《达・芬奇密码》，一跃而成畅销作家中的黑马，这部小说2003年一出版随即登上纽约时报畅销书排行榜第一名，现在已是有史以来最畅销的小说之一（尽管也受到了严苛的批评）。到2006年全球销畅量已累积达6050万本，丹・布朗前几部小说也跟着大卖。他的四部小说2004年同时进入纽约时报畅销书排行榜。2005年，他被《时代》杂志列入年度百大最有影响力的人，《福布斯》杂志将丹・布朗评选为2005年百大名流第12名，估计他年收入达7600万美元，《时代》杂志估计他光是《达・芬奇密码》就有2500万美元的进帐。	<br><br>
	
在2004年10月，丹・布朗和家人捐款220万美元给菲利普艾斯特学院，祝贺父亲获得总统荣誉奖，设立“查理・布朗科技基金”，用于“提供电脑和高科技设备给贫困的学生”。丹・布朗对密码学、密钥和密码兴趣浓厚，一直都是他故事里的主题，评论家常对书里的密码学行话和科技用语进行探究，他的小说已经被翻译超过40种语言。	<br><br>
	
2006年，哥伦比亚电影公司推出由丹・布朗同名小说改编的电影《达・芬奇密码》，朗・霍华担任导演，汤姆・汉克斯饰演主角罗拔・兰登教授，奥黛丽・塔图饰演索菲・纳芙，伊恩・麦克莱恩爵士饰演利・提宾。这部电影被认为是2006年最令人期待的影片，5月17日在戛纳电影节首映，评语却是一片唱衰。丹・布朗列名为电影《达・芬奇密码》的执行制片，为电影设计了不同的密码。丹・布朗自编自奏的歌曲《Phiano》也收录在电影原声带里面。	<br><br>
	
丹・布朗2007年的作品《所罗门之钥》(后正式命名为《失落的秘符》)，场景将设定在美国华盛顿特区，讲述“秘密结社”共济会。丹・布朗的促销网站说，《达・芬奇密码》的书皮藏有一个谜题，答案就是下一本小说的主题。（两次提到位于美国维吉尼亚州朗利 (维吉尼亚州)中央情报局总部的克里普托斯雕像）丹・布朗在早先的作品中，也玩过这样的手法。例如，《骗局》书末也有一个谜题，解开之后答案是“《达・芬奇密码》即将面市”。	<br><br>
	
在《天使与魔鬼》、《达・芬奇密码》、《失落的秘符》三本书中的主要人物都是符号学罗伯特・兰登，带领读者一起探索疑云。三本书因此可说是前后续集。	<br><br>

Daniel "Dan" Brown (born June 22, 1964) is a renowned American author of thriller fiction who is best known for the 2003 bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code. Brown's novels are treasure hunts set in a 24-hour period,[1] and feature the recurring themes of cryptography, keys, symbols, codes, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 52 languages, and as of 2012, sold over 200 million copies. Two of them, The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, have been adapted into films.	<br><br>
	
Brown's novels that feature the lead character Robert Langdon also include historical themes and Christianity as motifs, and as a result, have generated controversy. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian, though he is on a 'constant spiritual journey' himself, and says that his book The Da Vinci Code is simply "an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate" and suggests that the book may be used "as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith."	<br><br>
	
At 200 million books sold, he is one of the highest selling authors of all time and with only six books, he has achieved these sales writing fewer books than anyone above him on the list.[citation needed] The Robert Langdon series is currently[when?] the seventh highest selling series of all time.	<br><br>
Dan Brown was born and raised in Exeter, New Hampshire, United States, the eldest of three children. He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father Richard G. Brown was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks from 1968 until his retirement in 1997.[2][3] Both of Brown's parents are also singers and musicians, having served as church choir masters, with his mother also serving as church organist.[4] Brown was raised an Episcopalian,[2] but has stated he had drifted away from Christianity before finding a renewed interest in religion.[5]	<br><br>
	
Brown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household as a child, where codes and ciphers were the linchpin tying together the mathematics, music and languages in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working out anagrams and crossword puzzles, and he and his siblings participated in elaborate treasure hunts devised by their father on birthdays and holidays. On Christmas, for example, Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the tree, but followed a treasure map with codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to find the gifts.[6] Brown's relationship with his father inspired that of Sophie Neveu and Jacques Sauniere in The Da Vinci Code, and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts.[7]	<br><br>
	
After graduating from Phillips Exeter, Brown attended Amherst College, where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity. He played squash, sang in the Amherst Glee Club, and was a writing student of visiting novelist Alan Lelchuk. Brown spent the 1985 school year abroad in Seville, Spain, where he was enrolled in an art history course at the University of Seville.[6] Brown graduated from Amherst in 1986. 	<br><br>

After graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a collection of tracks such as "Happy Frogs" and "Suzuki Elephants"; it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled Perspective, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies.	<br><br>
	
In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School.	<br><br>
	
He also joined the National Academy of Songwriters, and participated in many of its events. It was there that he met Blythe Newlon, a woman 12 years his senior, who was the Academy's Director of Artist Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire.[10]	<br><br>
	
In 1993 Brown released the CD Dan Brown, which included songs such as "976-Love" and "If You Believe in Love."	<br><br>
	
In 1994 Brown released a CD titled Angels & Demons. Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for the novel Angels & Demons. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her "for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist." The CD included songs such as "Here in These Fields" and the religious ballad "All I Believe."[11]	<br><br>
	
Brown and his wife moved to his home town in New Hampshire in 1993. Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at Lincoln Akerman School, a small school for KC8th grade with about 250 students, in Hampton Falls.	<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
While on vacation in Tahiti in 1993,[6] Brown read Sidney Sheldon's novel The Doomsday Conspiracy, and was inspired to become a writer of thrillers.[6][13][14] He started work on Digital Fortress, setting much of it in Seville, where he had studied in 1985. He also co-wrote a humor book with his wife, 187 Men to Avoid: A Survival Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman, under the pseudonym "Danielle Brown." The book's author profile reads, "Danielle Brown currently lives in New England: teaching school, writing books, and avoiding men." The copyright is attributed to Dan Brown.	<br><br>
	
In 1996 Brown quit teaching to become a full-time writer. Digital Fortress was published in 1998. His wife, Blythe, did much of the book's promotion, writing press releases, booking Brown on talk shows, and setting up press interviews. A few months later, Brown and his wife released The Bald Book, another humor book. It was officially credited to his wife, though a representative of the publisher said that it was primarily written by Brown. Brown subsequently wrote Angels & Demons and Deception Point, released in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the former of which was the first to feature the lead character, Harvard symbology expert Robert Langdon.	<br><br>
	
Brown's first three novels had little success, with fewer than 10,000 copies in each of their first printings. His fourth novel, The Da Vinci Code, became a bestseller, going to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list during its first week of release in 2003. It is now credited with being one of the most popular books of all time, with 81 million copies sold worldwide as of 2009.[15][16] Its success has helped push sales of Brown's earlier books. In 2004 all four of his novels were on the New York Times list in the same week,[17] and in 2005 he made Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of the year. Forbes magazine placed Brown at No. 12 on their 2005 "Celebrity 100" list, and estimated his annual income at US$76.5 million. The Times estimated his income from Da Vinci Code sales as $250 million.	<br><br>
	
Brown's third novel featuring Robert Langdon, The Lost Symbol, was released on September 15, 2009.[18] According to the publisher, on its first day the book sold over one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada, prompting the printing of 600,000 hardcover copies in addition to the five million first printing.[19] The story takes place in Washington D.C. over a period of 12 hours, and features the Freemasons. Brown's promotional website states that puzzles hidden in the book jacket of The Da Vinci Code, including two references to the Kryptos sculpture at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, give hints about the sequel. This repeats a theme from some of Brown's earlier work.[citation needed]	<br><br>
	
Brown's fourth novel featuring Robert Langdon, Inferno is a mystery thriller novel released on May 14, 2013, by Doubleday.[20] It immediately became a bestseller.[21]	<br><br>
	
In a 2006 interview, Brown has stated that he had ideas for about 12 future books featuring Robert Langdon.[22]	<br><br>
	
Characters in Brown's books are often named after real people in his life. Robert Langdon is named after John Langdon, the artist who created the ambigrams used for the Angels & Demons CD and novel. Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is named after "On A Claire Day" cartoonist friend Carla Ventresca. In the Vatican Archives, Langdon recalls a wedding of two people named Dick and Connie, which are the names of his parents. Robert Langdon's editor Jonas Faukman is named after Brown's real life editor Jason Kaufman. Brown also said that characters were based on a New Hampshire librarian, and a French teacher at Exeter, Andre Vernet. Cardinal Aldo Baggia, in Angels & Demons, is named after Aldo Baggia, instructor of modern languages at Phillips Exeter Academy.[23]	<br><br>
	
In interviews, Brown has said that his wife is an art historian and painter. When they met, she was the Director of Artistic Development at the National Academy for Songwriters in Los Angeles. During the 2006 lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement in The Da Vinci Code, information was introduced at trial that showed that Blythe did research for the book.[24] In one article, she was described as "chief researcher."[	<br><br>

Digital Fortress is a techno-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 1998 by St. Martin's Press. The book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored information on the private lives of citizens, and the possible civil liberties and ethical implications using such technology.	<br><br>
	
	
Plot summary	<br><br>
	
When the United States National Security Agency's code-breaking supercomputer (TRANSLTR) encounters a new and complex code―Digital Fortress―that it cannot break, Commander Trevor Strathmore calls in Susan Fletcher, their head cryptographer, to crack it. She discovers that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with the NSA's intrusion into people's private lives. Tankado intends to auction the code's algorithm on his website and have his partner, "NDAKOTA", release it for free if he dies. Essentially holding the NSA hostage, the agency is determined to stop Digital Fortress from becoming a threat to national security.	<br><br>
	
When Tankado does indeed die in Seville, of what appears to be a heart attack, Strathmore asks David Becker (Susan's fiancé) to travel to Seville and recover a ring that Tankado was wearing when he died. The ring is suspected to have the code that unlocks Digital Fortress. However, Becker soon discovers that Tankado gave the ring away immediately before his death. Each person he questions in the search for the ring is murdered by Hulohot, a mysterious assassin.	<br><br>
	
Meanwhile, telephone calls between "North Dakota" and Numataka (chairman of a large computer company in Tokyo) reveal that North Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado in order to gain access to the passcode on his ring and speed up the release of the algorithm. At the NSA, Fletcher's investigation leads her to believe that Greg Hale, a fellow NSA employee, is North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, an NSA technician who is unaware of the Digital Fortress code breaking failure and believes Digital Fortress to be a virus, conducts his own investigation into whether Strathmore allowed Digital Fortress to bypass Gauntlet (NSA's virus/worm filter). However, Chartrukian is murdered by being pushed off the catwalk in the sub-levels of TRANSLTR by an unknown assailant. Since Hale and Strathmore were both in the sub-levels, Fletcher assumes that Hale is the killer; however, Hale claims that he witnessed Strathmore killing Chartrukian. Chartrukian's fall also damages TRANSLTR's cooling system.	<br><br>
	
Hale holds Fletcher and Strathmore hostage to prevent himself from being arrested for the murder. It is then that Hale explains that the e-mail he supposedly received from Tankado was actually in his inbox because he was snooping on Strathmore, who was also watching Tankado's e-mail account. After the encounter, Hale's name is cleared when Fletcher discovers through a tracer that North Dakota and Ensei Tankado are actually the same person, as "NDAKOTA" is an anagram of "Tankado". Strathmore exposes himself when he fatally shoots Hale, and arranges it to appear as a suicide. Susan later discovers through Strathmore's pager that he is the one who hired Hulohot. Becker later kills Hulohot in a violent confrontation.	<br><br>
	
Chapters told from Strathmore's perspective reveal his motives. By hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring, and at the same time arranging for Hulohot to kill him, would facilitate a romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor, and enable him to unlock Digital Fortress. By making phone calls to Numataka impersonating as "North Dakota", he thought he could partner with Numataka Corporation to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with his own backdoor Trojan so that the NSA can spy on every computer equipped with these chips. However, Strathmore was unaware that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm once unlocked, "eating away" at the NSA databank's security and allowing "any third-grader with a modem" to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR overheats, Strathmore commits suicide by standing next to the machine as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but soon after David Becker figures out the password (3, the difference between the Hiroshima nuclear bomb, Isotope 235, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb, isotope 238, a reference to the nuclear bombs that killed his mother and left him crippled), and is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any significant data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Numataka is Ensei Tankado's father. Numataka left Tankado the day he was born since Tankado was a deformed child.	<br><br>

Plot	<br><br>
	
美国大选在即，以猛烈抨击现任总统航空航天预算浮滥的总统候选人塞奇威克・塞克斯顿参议员获得了暂时的优势。此时现任总统团队据美国国家航空航天局在陨石中发现外星生物化石的消息，派遣与父亲塞克斯顿参议员决裂的女儿、美国国家侦察局汲思员（负责简化报告供总统阅读）蕾切尔・塞克斯顿、前往北极和四位具有公信力的非官方科学家深入调查证实，却在北极遭到三角洲部队精锐队员连环追杀。此时此刻，政治风云中心华盛顿大选在即。情节随着陨石的真假难辨而深入。	<br><br>
	
	
Intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton works for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Her father, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, is a presidential candidate who is more popular than incumbent President of the United States, Zachary Herney. The president sends her to the Arctic as part of a team of experts to confirm and authenticate findings made by NASA deep within the Milne Ice Shelf on Ellesmere Island, a very dense meteorite. In it are insect fossils very similar to, but not the same as, species on earth. NASA claims this as proof of extraterrestrial life.	<br><br>
	
The discovery is something NASA needs to regain the old grandeur in the light of recent failures. Senator Sexton uses these failures as an example of government overspending to further his campaign; he wants to abolish NASA and direct the funding toward public schools instead. In order to ensure that the discovery is not tarnished by the reputation that NASA has developed, the president sends four leading civilian scientists to the Arctic to verify the meteorite's authenticity: Michael Tolland, a famous oceanographer and TV personality; Corky Marlinson, a brilliant but socially inept astrophysicist; Norah Mangor, a prickly glaciologist and Wailee Ming, a palaeontologist.	<br><br>
	
A Delta Force team is also monitoring the discovery site for an unknown commander. Ming observes an irregularity within the pit from which the meteorite was extracted. He reaches into the water to obtain a sample and falls in and drowns, when the Delta Force team have their surveillance microbot attack him.	<br><br>
	
When Tolland sees the irregularity within the pit, he shares it with Marlinson, Rachel and Mangor. They confirm that there is sea water in what should be a closed area with only freshwater. The four go outside to scan the ice from a distance. The scan shows Ming's body in the water and a column of frozen sea ice beneath the meteorite where it was drilled up into the glacier. Upon discovering this, the Delta Force team opens fire on them, killing Mangor and leaving Rachael, Tolland and Marlinson to perish on an ice floe. The three, however, are picked up by the Navy submarine USS Charlotte and manage to inform the president's advisor and the NRO director about the incident. Marjorie Tench, the president's advisor, hushes up their report while the NRO director, William Pickering, has them airlifted from the sub and taken back to U.S. mainland.	<br><br>
	
Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Senator Sexton's aide, Gabrielle Ashe, meets with her anonymous contact inside the White House who has been providing the reliable reports on the government expenditure. The contact is revealed to be Tench, who attempts to blackmail Gabrielle with photos of her extramarital affair with Senator Sexton.	<br><br>
	
Senator Sexton's true motive for abolishing NASA is revealed to the interests of private corporations from the Space Frontier Foundation, who wish to profit from space exploration. Rachel is unaware of this, and believes that the president and NASA are part of the conspiracy to kill them. If so, their motive would be to cover up evidence that the meteorite is fake and solely designed to gain support for the incumbent President in the upcoming election.	<br><br>
	
The Delta Force attacks the three aboard Tolland's ship off the New Jersey coast, where Rachel sends a fax message to her father asking for help. As Rachael, Tolland and Marlinson work together to incapacitate or kill two of the Delta Force squad in self-defense, Pickering reveals himself as their commander. He tells Rachel about her father's true motivations for becoming President, and that he (Pickering) masterminded the fake meteorite to hurt Senator Sexton's campaign. Tolland disrupts the ships balance, which sends the landed Delta Force helicopter off the ship into the sea. The intense heat at the bottom ignites the ordnance on the helicopter, tearing a magma plume at the bottom of the sea, creating a water vortex. The ship and Pickering are sucked in by the vortex, while a Coast Guard Osprey picks up Rachael, Tolland and Marlinson.	<br><br>
	
Senator Sexton attempts to publicize Rachael's fax, incriminating the president and NASA. However, during his press conference, Rachael and Gabrielle swap the envelopes containing copies of Rachael's fax with those containing evidences of his extramarital affairs, humiliating him. By the end of the story, Michael and Rachel have developed a romantic relationship.	<br><br>

情节梗概	<br><br>
	
	
 	
虔诚的上帝信徒“欧核中心”的杰出科学家列奥纳多.维特勒毕生致力于以科学的手段证明神的存在。他和其养女、神秘妩媚的科学家维多利亚在实验室里进行了高度机密的试验，成功地制造出了一种极其强大的能量“反物质”。	<br><br>
	
在这个重大发现尚未对外公布时，列奥纳多就在实验室里惨遭杀害，一颗眼珠被凶手挖走，胸口上赫然印着一个神秘的标记“光照派”。更令人震惊的是，藏在地下的反物质不翼而飞，而这些反物质一旦与物质相遇便会产生巨大的能量，足以摧毁一座城市。	<br><br>
	
哈佛大学的符号学专家罗伯特・兰登应“欧核中心”负责人之邀，前来调查这个神秘的符号。就在当天，失踪的反物质被人发现位于梵蒂冈城地下某处。离开了实验中心的反物质，在二十四小时之后就会自行爆炸，而这天正是天主教教皇选举日。	<br><br>
	
来自世界各地的天主教红衣主教会聚在梵蒂冈城，藏在地下的反物质就如同一枚定时炸弹，如不能及时找到，整个梵蒂冈城便会成为一片废墟。还有六个钟头，刻不容缓，兰登与列奥纳多之女一起踏上了前往梵蒂冈的冒险之旅。	<br><br>
	
两人在查找反物质的过程中，竞发现传说中几十年前就消亡的光照派还活跃于世，而且历史上许多科学家皆是其成员。光照派沉寂了几十年之后，竟然瞄准教皇选举日这天对天主教进行复仇，而寻找杀人凶手及光照派的线索竟藏在伽利略和弥尔顿的作品中！两人与神秘的幕后操纵者斗智斗勇，足迹遍布古老废弃的教堂、巷道、地下室，还有阴森可怖的地下墓穴，一个个惊世之谜也随着情节的深入而被揭开。	<br><br>
	
	
《天使与魔鬼》的创作灵感来自于作者的一次梵蒂冈之旅。丹・布朗在游览梵蒂冈的地下通道时得知，这个秘密地道就是早期的天主教教皇躲避敌人追赶时的藏身之所，而几百年前，最让梵蒂冈畏惧的敌人就是一个名为“光照派”的秘密组织。这个组织由一些受到宗教迫害的科学家组成，他们发誓要对梵蒂冈进行复仇。时至今日，当代许多历史学家还对这个组织的存在深信不疑，而且认为它是全球势力最强大的组织之一，它渗透到世界的各个角落，不为人知……丹・布朗受此启发，创作出这部以科学和宗教的关系为主题的惊悚悬疑小说。[	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
作品主题	<br><br>
科学与宗教的论战成了这部小说的主题。这一论战从一开始就没有停止过，几百年前不计其数的科学家遭到教廷迫害，时至今日，是讲授达尔文的进化论还是宣传上帝创世说仍是西方大学里争论不休的问题。人类从何而来，世界的起源到底在哪里，这一直是科学与宗教试图解决的问题。小说中的科学家列奥纳多通过模拟宇宙大爆炸来证明物质从“无”中产生，从而论证了上帝的创世说。他认为，神、佛、耶和华都是指的同一种事物，科学和宗教说明的都是一个道理所有的一切都是由纯粹的能量创造出来的。当记者问丹.布朗如何看待科学与宗教的论战时，他说：“在许多方面，我将科学和宗教视为同一事物，二者都是人对神性的追问，不同之处在于，宗教诉诸问题本身，而科学侧重对答案的追寻。”丹.布朗认为，科学和宗教只是讲述同一个故事的两种语言而已。小说表达了对信仰丧失和科学万能论的担忧。人类的科学水平不断提高，而心灵、道德的发展相对来说却有些滞后，当二者的失衡到了一定程度的时候，其可能出现的后果就难免令人忧心忡忡。作者以“天使与魔鬼”作为小说的标题，寓意深刻而又丰富。“路西弗”（撒旦在堕落前的称呼）被光照派视作光的使者，光照派的秘密集会地也是由“天使”的指引才能找到。被宗教迫害的人们将天主教视为魔鬼，而狂热的宗教徒则认为科学是毁灭人类的力量，是反宗教的魔鬼。谁是天使谁是魔鬼，我们似乎没有必要去问个究竟，因为我们知道，天使与魔鬼有时只有一步之遥。科学与宗教，人性与神性，孰是孰非，至今没有定论，而丹・布朗在小说中恰到好处地找到了处理二者的平衡点，留给了读者更多的思考空间。[1] 	<br><br>
	
在历史上，宗教曾经孕育出科学，也与科学产生过激烈的冲突。但在现实中，宗教已经被边缘化，科学占据了主导。丹・布朋把这一主题融入到他的小说当中，表明了他对科学与宗教关系的看法：科学与宗教是人类文化的两个重要组成部分，两者相互补充，相互促进，不可或缺，既相互冲突又相互统一。小说中无不反映了作者对当今社会科学万能论的担忧。	<br><br>
	
小说中提到教皇通过科学技术能和自己深爱着的修女在保持肉体纯洁的情况下拥有自己的爱情结晶，这一情节的描写就是为了避免矫枉过正、过分夸大宗教的作用而忽视科学的地位。列奥纳多通过科学的手段创造出反物质的最终目的是为了证实上帝的存在，这不能不说是丹・布朗的一大创造，同时也表达了他消解科学与宗教二元对立的主题。	<br><br>
	
当今社会科学技术迅猛发展，但道德水平的提高却大大滞后。科学是一把双刃剑，可以造福人类，同样也可以奴役入类。《天使与魔鬼》反映了作者对当今犹如脱缰野马般的科学发展表现出了担忧。小说中虽然没有明确指出“天使”与“魔鬼”所指何物，但从描述的内容来看，其对立的二元性恰恰隐含了作者对科学发展双重性的理解。小说表现出作者对人类生存困境的忧思，对现代社会的人文关怀。[2] 	<br><br>
	
丹・布朗选择以厚重的历史为背景，以神秘的宗教和先进的科学为对象，在讲述故事的同时给读者以大量的信息材料，并让我们在阅读中获得美感体验，更重要的是小说中提及的问题充满争议，而这些争议又让人不得不审视和思索。在本书前言中，作者提及了一个发人深省的问题：先进的科学技术，这种极易爆炸的反物质是能为人类造福，还是会被用于制造有史以来毁灭性最强的武器？这一问题在当今科技飞速发展的时刻恰恰触到了人们最敏感的神经，也正是人们激烈争辩或者默默沉思的问题。而阿米斯在《小说美学》中指出，“正是人们对宗教助兴趣和他们对宗教的困惑才构成了这些小说的魅力”。《天使与魔鬼》正是以科学和宗教的论战来拴释小说的主题，在科学与宗教的碰撞和交融中，布朗调起了读者的兴致，同时让我们困惑不已地重新审视人性和神性，思考人类的现在和将来。丹・布朗把主题摆到了读者面前，“不是简单地灌输到我们的智力范围内，而是诉诸于我们的情感、意识和想象”。他通过小说里人物对科学和宗教的看法向读者提出了同样的问题，但对此却守口如瓶不加评论。同时，作者敢于把罗马教廷种种不为人知的事实搬上书本且不带有任何讨好的口吻，这也会引发争论。[	<br><br>
丹.布朗在一开始就声称，小说所涉及的罗马的艺术品、陵墓、地道、建筑都是建立在史实的基础之上，“光照派”也是确有其事，绝非空穴来风。他在小说中还大量地引用历史资料和历史人物，将真实的人和事纳入虚幻的空间中，制造出一种亦真亦幻、虚实难辨的气氛，体现出带有强烈浪漫主义倾向的晚期后现代小说风格。在体验紧张、刺激、神秘以及甜蜜的阅读快感时，读者随兰登做了一次逼真且独特的瑞士、梵蒂冈和罗马之旅。在“欧核中心”，读者可以听到对最新的科学发现的描述。丹.布朗将高深莫测的物理知识像家常话一样娓娓道来，让科学的门外汉对其魅力也能窥见一二。梵蒂冈之行更是惊心动魄。随着兰登的脚步，读者可以在地图上找到书中主人公们“游览”过的广场、街道和教堂，而且，对鲜为人知的教皇的生活、教会的仪式也能有所涉猎。丹.布朗就像一位出色而奇特的导游，不是带领读者去日常的观光点，而是胆大妄为地带领读者擅闯禁地，屡屡遇险又处处逢生。在旅程中，丹.布朗还旁征博引，将符号学、历史学、天文学、宗教、建筑学的知识呈给读者，让不同口味的读者都能找到自己的兴趣点和关照对象。[	<br><br>
	
	
Angels & Demons is a 2000 bestselling mystery-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published by Pocket Books. The novel introduces the character Robert Langdon, who is also the protagonist of Brown's subsequent 2003 novel, The Da Vinci Code; his 2009 novel, The Lost Symbol; and the 2013 novel Inferno. Angels and Demons shares many stylistic literary elements with its sequel, such as conspiracies of secret societies, a single-day time frame, and the Catholic Church. Ancient history, architecture, and symbolism are also heavily referenced throughout the book. A film adaptation was released on May 15, 2009. The Da Vinci Code film had been released in 2006.	<br><br>
	
Background	<br><br>
	
The book contains several ambigrams created by real-life typographer John Langdon.[1] Besides the "Angels And Demons" and "Illuminati" designs, the title of the book is also presented as an ambigram on the hardcover book jacket (see illustration at right on this page), and on the inside cover of the paperback versions. The book also contains ambigrams of the words Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, which has served to bring the art of ambigrams to public attention by virtue of the popularity of the book.[2] The "Illuminati Diamond" mentioned in the book is an ambigram of the four elements arranged in the shape of a diamond.[1]	<br><br>
	
Plot	<br><br>
	
CERN director Maximilian Kohler discovers one of the facility's physicists, Leonardo Vetra, murdered. His chest is branded with an ambigram of the word "Illuminati". Kohler contacts Robert Langdon, an expert on the Illuminati, who determines that the ambigram is authentic. Kohler calls Vetra's adopted daughter Vittoria to the scene, and it is ascertained that the Illuminati have stolen a canister containing antimatter ― a substance with destructive potential comparable to a nuclear weapon. When at CERN the canister is stored in a unique electrical charger which ensures the antimatter's stability but when removed its back-up battery provides power for 24 hours after which the anti-matter will self-destruct. The canister is somewhere in Vatican City, with a security camera in front of it, as its digital clock counts down to the explosion.	<br><br>
	
Langdon and Vittoria make their way to Vatican City, where the Pope has recently died. They are told that the four Preferiti, the cardinals who are most likely to be elected pope, are missing. Langdon and Vittoria search for the Preferiti in hopes that they will also find the antimatter canister. Their search is assisted by Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca (the late pope's closest aide) and the Vatican's Swiss Guard.	<br><br>
	
Langdon attempts to retrace the steps of the "Path of Illumination", a process once used by the Illuminati as a means of inducting new members; aspirants to the order were required to follow a series of subtle clues left in various landmarks in and around Rome. The clues indicate the secret meeting place of the Illuminati. Langdon sets off on the Path of Illumination in hopes of delivering the Preferiti and recovering the antimatter canister.	<br><br>
	
	
The Path leads Langdon to four locations in Rome, each associated with one of the primordial elements: 'Earth', 'Air', 'Fire', and 'Water'. Langdon finds one of the Preferiti murdered in a way thematically related to each location's related element. The first cardinal was branded with an Earth ambigram and had soil forced down his throat, suffocating him; the second was branded with an Air ambigram and had his lungs punctured; the third was branded with a Fire ambigram and was burned alive; and the fourth was branded with a Water ambigram and was wrapped in chains and left to drown at the bottom of a fountain.	<br><br>
After finding the bodies of the first two Preferiti, Langdon hurries to the Santa Maria della Vittoria Basilica and finds the Preferiti's abductor in the act of setting the third cardinal on fire. The kidnapper is an unnamed assassin who is working under the orders of the Illuminati master "Janus", whose true identity is unknown. Commander Olivetti is killed and the assassin kidnaps Vittoria. Langdon escapes and accosts the assassin at the final element's landmark (Water), but is unable to save the cardinal.	<br><br>
	
Langdon must complete the Path of Illumination in order to find the assassin and rescue Vittoria. His search leads him to Castel Sant'Angelo, which hides a tunnel leading directly into the pope's chambers in the Vatican. Langdon frees Vittoria, and together they send the assassin falling several hundred feet to his death. The two hurry back to St. Peter's Basilica, where they find that Kohler has arrived to confront the Camerlengo in private. Langdon and Vittoria fear that Kohler is Janus, and that he has come to murder the Camerlengo. Hearing the Camerlengo scream in agony from being branded with the Illuminati Diamond, the Swiss Guards burst into the room and open fire on Kohler. Just before he dies, Kohler gives Langdon a videotape that he says to show to the media.	<br><br>
	
With time running out, the Swiss Guard evacuates the Basilica. The Camerlengo rushes back in, claiming that he has received a vision from God revealing the location of the antimatter canister. With Langdon in pursuit, the Camerlengo ventures into the catacombs and finds the canister sitting atop the tomb of Saint Peter. Langdon and the Camerlengo retrieve the antimatter and get in a helicopter with only minutes to spare. The Camerlengo manages to parachute safely onto the roof of St. Peter's just as the canister explodes harmlessly in the sky. The crowd in St. Peter's Square look in awe as the Camerlengo stands triumphantly before them. Because of this "miracle", the papal conclave debate whether to elect the Camerlengo as the new Pope. Langdon managed to survive the explosion by using a window cover from the helicopter as a parachute, and landed in the Tiber River.	<br><br>
	
After viewing Kohler's tape Langdon, Vittoria, and the cardinals confront the Camerlengo. Shortly before the beginning of the novel, the Pope met with Leonardo Vetra who believed that anti-matter was capable of establishing a link between humanity and God. Vetra's beliefs caused great discomfort to the Camerlengo. While discussing Vetra, the pope reveals that his support is due to science having given him a son. Without waiting to hear the explanation (that the child was the result of artificial insemination), and horrified that the Pope appeared to have broken his vow of chastity, the Camerlengo plots to "rectify" the situation. He poisoned the pope and, under the guise of an Illuminati master (Janus), he recruited the assassin to kill Vetra, steal the antimatter, and kidnap and murder the Preferiti. The Camerlengo planted the antimatter in St. Peter's, feigned his last-minute vision from God, and retrieved the canister just in time to save the Vatican from the ensuing explosion. This was in hope to unite the struggling Catholic Church. The Illuminati "involvement" was merely a plot engineered by the Camerlengo to cover his own plans. Upon the discovery and the Camerlengo's attempts to justify his killing of the Pope, Mortati, Dean of the College of Cardinals, reveals that Carlo Ventresca (the Camerlengo) was in fact the biological son of the late pope, conceived with a nun through artificial insemination. Overcome with guilt, Ventresca soaks himself in oil and sets himself on fire before a crowd of onlookers in St. Peter's Square. His ashes are recovered by Mortati, who places them in an urn inside his father's sarcophagus. It is revealed that the Cardinals' endorsing of him would in fact have made him Pope by acclamation. Mortati is elected his successor by the conclave, and Langdon and Vittoria reunite at Hotel Bernini where they share an extensive meal before making love. The last brand, the long-lost "Illuminati Diamond", is delivered by a Swiss Guard to Langdon on an indefinite loan, provided he would return it to the other Illuminati brands - long-since owned by the Vatican - through his final will.	<br><br>
	
	
Characters	<br><br>
	
Robert Langdon: A professor of symbology at Harvard University and the protagonist of the novel. He is flown to CERN to help investigate the murder of Leonardo Vetra. He is described as wearing a Harris Tweed jacket, a turtleneck sweater, and a pair of chino pants. His name is a tribute to John Langdon.	<br><br>
Leonardo Vetra: A scientist working at CERN and a priest. He is researching on antimatter when he is murdered by the Assassin. He is also the adoptive father of Vittoria.	<br><br>
Vittoria Vetra: The adopted daughter of Vetra. She, like her father, works with CERN. She is a strict vegetarian. Her research focuses on biology and physics. The reader learns early in the novel that Vittoria worked with her father in their research of antimatter.	<br><br>
Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca: The Camerlengo (Papal Chamberlain) during the conclave. He murdered the pope, who is later revealed to have been his biological father. His codename for dealing with the assassin, "Janus", was taken from the two-faced Roman god of beginnings and ends.	<br><br>
Cardinal Saverio Mortati: The most senior cardinal in the conclave, and the current Dean of the College of Cardinals. He was the Devil's Advocate for the late pope.	<br><br>
Commander Olivetti: The commandant of the Swiss Guard. He is initially skeptical on the claims of Langdon and Vittoria until he talks with the Hassassin. He, along with other Swiss Guards, search desperately for the missing antimatter hidden somewhere at the Vatican. He is killed by the Hassassin at the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria.	<br><br>
Captain Rocher: The second in command after Commander Olivetti. He is contacted by Max Kohler telling his knowledge on the real cause of the events. He is killed by Lt. Chartrand, who was under the impression that Rocher was an Illuminatus.	<br><br>
Hassassin: The killer hired by Janus to fulfill his plans. He is of Middle Eastern origin and displays his sadistic lust for women throughout the novel. He murders Leonardo Vetra, the Preferiti, and Commander Olivetti. He dies after being pushed from a balcony by Langdon at the Castel Sant'Angelo and breaking his back on a pile of cannonballs below.	<br><br>
Maximilian Kohler: The director of CERN. He is feared at CERN despite his paralysis. His wheelchair contains electronic gadgets such as a computer, telephone, pager, video camera, and a gun. He contacts Langdon to help him find the killer of his friend, Leonardo Vetra. He blames the Church for his paralysis, due to his highly religious parents denying him medical care as a child, becoming a scientist as a way to rebel.	<br><br>
	
	
	
Carlo Ventresca	<br><br>
	
Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca (named Patrick McKenna in the film adaptation) a.k.a. Janus is the main antagonist of Angels and Demons. Carlo Ventresca is the Camerlengo and faithful servant to the Roman Catholic Church during the papal conclave in the Vatican City. In the 2009 film adaptation, to accommodate Scottish actor Ewan McGregor who plays him, Ventresca's name is changed and he is from Northern Ireland instead of Italy.	<br><br>
	
He was raised by his mother Maria, whom he used to call Maria Benedetta (the blessed Mary). To the questions about his father, she would always reply that he had died before Carlo was born and that now God was his father. She raised him a strict Catholic by bringing him to Mass every day.	<br><br>
	
During a vacation on Sicily, the church they visited came under attack by the Red Brigades and Carlo was the sole survivor. In the film, the story was altered so that the attack occurred in Northern Ireland and the attackers were the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Later he would say that God had saved him by leading him into a safe corner.	<br><br>
	
A bishop from Palermo then took him in and Carlo lived and learned under monks. But at the age of 16 he was conscripted into the Italian army. There he refused to fire a weapon, so the army taught him to fly a helicopter and to parachute. After serving two years, he entered a seminary. When the bishop was elected Pope, he named Carlo his Camerlengo.	<br><br>
	
Before the initial events occurred within the novel, Carlo had been sent, by the Vatican, to CERN (European Center for Nuclear Research) to meet with scientist Leonardo Vetra. This was to investigate claims that a discovery of profound religious significance had occurred. Here, he was shown the procedure to create antimatter. Carlo was ethically disturbed by this discovery, and reported his findings to the Pope, which was met with a positive response. The Pope claimed that he owed a great debt to science, and he agreed with Leonardo Vetra that the discovery held profound religious significance. Carlo was saddened to hear this from the Pope, so the Pope explained that he had fathered a child, so he owed a deep debt to science. Shocked and disappointed about this betrayal to God and the church, Carlo abandoned the Pope before the situation was explained. Carlo found himself on St. Peter's tomb where he believed he received instructions from God.	<br><br>
	
Carlo carried out this believed instruction by poisoning the Pope with lethal dose of Heparin (which the pope required for his illness). Due to his role as the Camerlengo, he took the authority of the Holy See while a new Pope was elected (although without most of the Pope' prerogatives). During this time period, he hired an assassin to kill the four Cardinals held in the highest regard by the college, papabili or preferiti),thus ensuring a confusion in the Conclave as to who should be elected to the papacy.	<br><br>
	
He covered up many of these actions by assuming an alias as the leader of the Illuminati, known as Janus.	<br><br>
	
The novel then begins with the antimatter having been stolen from CERN and hidden in the Vatican, and used as a terrorist threat against the church. This is known to have been engineered by the Illuminati, which Carlo is claiming to be the leader of. The Illuminati claims that they wish to destroy the Vatican as vengeance for the murder and repression of science before the Age of Enlightenment.	<br><br>
	
During the novel, with one hour before the antimatter is due to destroy the Vatican, Maximilian Kohler claims to have information regarding the location of the antimatter, and reports to the Vatican to help. It then turns out that Kohler knew about the plans of the Camerlengo, and intended to unmask him. When he was confronted, he branded himself with the Illuminati diamond, claimed that Kohler was an Illuminatus and had him shot. During this time, Kohler has recorded the meeting on hidden camera.	<br><br>
	
Being carried outside to St Peter's Square due to his injuries, he suddenly awoke and jumped up, presenting the brand to the masses. Then he pretended to receive a heavenly message revealing the position of the antimatter, with only 30 minutes until its destruction. He and Langdon used a helicopter to try to get the antimatter away. Carlo took the sole parachute and landed safely in the Vatican Gardens (without the knowledge of the media or the devout in St Peter's Square). He then climbed up to the Basilica and presented himself a perfect miracle to the cheering masses.	<br><br>
	
Meanwhile, Langdon had listened to Kohler's video tape, which was handed to him as Kohler died, on which Carlo confessed that he had killed the Pope and that he was responsible for the terrorist threat and the murder of the Cardinals. In front of the horrified College of Cardinals, he tried to justify his actions, gathering only comprehension. Then, Saverio Mortati, the Cardinal Dean told him the truth about the Pope; that he had fallen in love with a nun called Maria, that their child had been fathered through artificial insemination and he therefore broke no vow. Mortati also told him the child's identity: Carlo Ventresca.	<br><br>
	
Horrified by the truth and his guilt, he burnt himself alive on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. His ashes, recovered by Mortati, later the new Pope, were put next to his father's sarcophagus.	<br><br>
	
Shortly thereafter, it becomes clear that Ventresca was elected Pope by a method called Acclamation by Adoration, which is when all the Cardinals freely chant one clergyman's name, which they did before Carlo lit himself on fire. He reigned for under 17 minutes, and therefore his burial next to his father's tomb in the Vatican grottoes was appropriate.	<br><br>
	
From early on in the story, the Camerlengo is revealed as extremely modern compared to other clergy. This is especially revealed when Lieutenant Chartrand remembers a conversation with the Camerlengo in which he asks about how God can be both omnipotent and benevolent. When he mentions children skateboarding, however, Chartrand understands that he is very "up with the times", so to speak.	<br><br>

Angels and Demons by Dan Brown<br><br>

(Semester at Sea/Die Weltumsegelung)<br><br>

宗教（Religion-Language）自尊（self-esteem）自控（self-control）自信（self-confidence）坚持-奇迹（miracles）<br><br>

Vittoria Vetra: Religion is like language or dress. We gravitate吸引toward the practices with which we were raised. In the end, though we are all proclaiming the same thing. That life has meaning. That we are grateful for the power that created us. <br><br>
Robert Langdon: So you’re saying that whether you are a Christian or a Muslim simply depends on where you were born?	<br><br>
(Shaman, Religions are at least as complex as language. SLA)<br><br>
Vittoria Vetra: Isn’t it obvious? Look at the diffusion of religion around the globe.<br><br>


Robert Langdon: So faith is random? (der Philosophie/Philosophy)<br><br>
Vittoria Vetra: Hardly. Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to Jesus, some us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves. <br><br>

(Semiotics)<br><br>
Camerlengo: Do you believe in God, Sir? (Revelation, Come Be My Light)<br><br>
Robert Langdon: Father, I simply believe that religion...<br><br>
Camerlengo: I did not ask if you believe what man says about God. I asked if you believe in God.<br><br>
Robert Langdon: I’m an academic. My mind tells me I will never understand God.<br><br>
Camerlengo: And your heart? (Passion & Faith, Resonance, the Secret)<br><br>
Robert Langdon: Tells me I am not meant to. Faith is a gift that I am yet to receive.<br><br>

Angels and Demons by Dan Brown<br><br>
	
Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca: To the Illuminati睿智的人 先觉者/光照派, and to those of science, let me say this. You have won the war. (Manichean /摩尼教 &《倚天屠龙记》& 任我行)<br><br>
The wheels have been in motion for a long time. Your victory has been inevitable. Never before has it been as obvious as it is at this moment. Science is the new god. (Kojève & Leo Strauss)<br><br>
Medicine, electronic communications, space travel, genetic manipulation (Biotech)… these are the miracles about which we now tell our children. These are the miracles we herald as proof that science will bring us the answers. The ancient stories of immaculate洁净\精确conceptions, burning bushes, and parting seas are no longer relevant. God has become obsolete废弃\过时. Science has won the battle. We concede承认. <br><br>
But science’s victory has cost every one of us. And it has cost us deeply. (Interstellar, Nolan & Thorne)<br><br>
Science may have alleviated 减轻 / the miseries of disease and drudgery辛苦工作 / and provided an array of gadgetry小器具/for our entertainment and convenience, but is has left us in a world without wonder. Our sunsets have been reduced to wavelengths and frequencies. The complexities of the universe have been shredded碎片 into mathematical equations. Even our self-worth as human beings has been destroyed. Science proclaims that Planet Earth and its inhabitants are a meaningless speck污点/微粒in the grand scheme. A cosmic accident. Even the technology that promises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now electronically connected to the globe, and yet we feel utterly alone. We are bombarded with violence, division, fracture破碎/断裂, and betrayal. Skepticism has become a virtue. Cynicism讥讽/愤世嫉俗/玩世不恭/犬儒主义/and demand for proof has become enlightened thought. Is it any wonder that humans now feel more depressed and defeated than they have at any point in human history? Does science hold anything sacred宗教的/神圣的? Science looks for answers by probing our unborn fetuses胎儿 /. Science even presumes to rearrange our own DNA. It shatters God’s world into smaller and smaller pieces in quest of meaning… and all it finds is more questions. <br><br>（The most dangerous enemy is that which no one fears!）<br><br>
The ancient war between science and religion is over. You have won. But you have not won fairly. You have not won by providing answers. You have won by so radically reorienting our society that the truths we once saw as signposts now seem inapplicable. Religion cannot keep up. Scientific growth is exponential指数增长. It feeds on itself like a virus. Every new breakthrough opens doors for new breakthroughs. Mankind took thousands of years to progress from the wheel to the car. Yet only decades from the car into space. Now we measure scientific progress in weeks. We are spinning out of control. The rift裂缝between us grows deeper and deeper, and as religion is left behind, people find themselves in a spiritual void. We cry out for meaning. And believe me, we do cry out. We see UFOs, engage in channeling, spirit contact, out-of-body experiences, mindquests ― all these eccentric古怪/异常ideas (heresy/evil cult) have a scientific veneer饰面/ 虚饰, but they are unashamedly irrational. They are the desperate cry of the modern soul, lonely and tormented, crippled跛/瘸/残疾 by its own enlightenment and its inability to accept meaning in anything removed from technology. (Wired)<br><br>
Science (Democracy), you say, will save us. Science, I say, has destroyed us. Since the days of Galileo, the church has tried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with misguided means, but always with benevolent好心肠 慈善intention. Even so, the temptations 诱惑are too great for man to resist. I warn you, look around yourselves. The promises of science have not been kept. Promises of efficiency and simplicity have bred nothing but pollution and chaos. We are a fractured折断/破碎 and frantic发疯似/发狂/厉害species… moving down a path of destruction. (An die Freude/Ode to Joy & We are the world, 观想)<br><br>
Who is this God science? Who is the God who offers his people power but no moral framework to tell you how to use that power? What kind of God gives a child fire but does not warn the child of its dangers? The language of science comes with no signposts about good and bad. Science textbooks tell us how to create a nuclear reaction, and yet they contain no chapter asking us if it is a good or a bad idea. (Navigation/Wandern)<br><br>
To science, I say this. The church is tired. We are exhausted from trying to be your sign posts. Our resources are drying up from our campaign to be the voice of balance as you plow犁耕/费力穿过blindly on in your quest for smaller chips and larger profits. We ask not why you will not govern yourselves, but how can you? Your world moves so fast that if you stop even for an instant to consider the implications of your actions, someone more efficient will whip past you in a blur. So you move on. You proliferate weapons of mass destruction, but it is the Pope who travels the world beseeching恳求/乞求 leaders to use restraint克制. You clone living creatures, but it is the church reminding us to consider the moral implications of our actions. You encourage people to interact on phones, TVs, computers, and Internet, but it is the church who opens its doors and reminds us to commune in person as we were meant to do. You even murder unborn babies in the name of research that will save lives. Again, it is the church who points the fallacy谬误 错误of that reasoning.<br><br>
And all the while, you proclaim the church is ignorant无知/愚昧. But who is more ignorant? The man who cannot define lightning, or the man who does not respect its awesome power? This church is reaching out to you. Reaching out to everyone. And yet the more we reach, the more you push us away. Show me proof there is a God, you say. I say use your telescopes to look to the heavens, and tell me how there could not be a God! You ask what does God look like. I say, where does that question come from? The answers are one and the same. Do you not see God in you science? How can you miss Him! You proclaim that even the slightest change in the force of gravity or the weight of an atom would have rendered提出/放弃/让与/归还 our universe a lifeless mist rather than our magnificent sea of heavenly bodies, and yet you fail to see God’s hand in this? Is it really so much easier to believe that we simply chose the right card from a deck of billions? Have we become so spiritually bankrupt that we would rather believe in mathematical impossibility than in a power greater than us? <br><br>
Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this. When we as a species abandon our trust in the power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability责任. Faith… all faiths… are admonitions 告诫 /劝告that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable… With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. If the outside world could see this church as I do… looking beyond the ritual of these walls… they would see a modern miracle… a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion怜悯/ 同情/恻隐之心in a world spinning out of control. (Maniac/Mutant/Messiah)<br><br>
Are we obsolete废弃/过时/退化? Are these men dinosaurs? Am I? Does the world really need a voice for the poor, the weak, the oppressed, and the unborn child? Do we really need souls like these who, though imperfect, spend their lives imploring恳求 each of us to read the signposts of morality and not lose our way?<br><br>
Tonight we are perched栖息 on a precipice悬崖. None of us can afford to be apathetic无感情/冷淡/无动于衷. Whether you see this evil as Satan, corruption, or immorality不道德/, the dark force is alive and growing every day. Do not ignore it. The force, though mighty, is not invincible无敌. Goodness can prevail. Listen to your hearts. Listen to God. Together we can step back from this abyss深渊/ 地狱.<br><br>
Pray with me.<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
《达・芬奇密码》给我们讲述了一个悬念迭起、惊心动魄的故事：正在巴黎出差的哈佛大学教授罗伯特・兰登午夜接到匿名电话，得知卢浮富博物馆馆长雅克・索尼埃被害，于是应召来到博物馆，对一系列与达・芬奇的艺术作品有关联的神秘符号进行分析和调查。在与索尼埃的孙女、密码破译天才索菲・奈芙联手对诸多奇形怪状的符号及密码进行整理的过程中，他发现一连串的线索就隐藏在达・芬奇的艺术作品当中。他发现了能解开历史上员难解之谜的一把钥匙，并与奈芙跟一位神秘的幕后操纵者展开了斗智斗勇的角逐，而他自己也因此成为一名被追逐者。除非他们能解开这个错综复杂的谜，否则，郇山隐修会苦心掩盖的惊天大秘密以及令人震惊的古老真相，终将永远消失。然而这个所谓的历史真相及重大秘密，在小说结尾却被消解，读者看到的只是一个出入意料但又令人信服的隐喻性解释。[	<br><br>
自《哈利・波特》出版之后，还没有一位作家设下这样的圈套哄骗读者，诱使他们屏住呼吸来追逐情节，并罪大恶极地公然以此为乐。	<br><br>
	
	
	
――《纽约时报》书评	<br><br>
	
达・芬奇密码（The Da Vinci Code，ISBN 0-385-50420-9）是美国作家丹・布朗的一部小说，2003年3月18日由兰登书屋出版。这本书以750万本的成绩打破美国小说销售记录，目前全球累积销售量更已突破8000万册[1]，成为有史以来最畅销的小说之一。这本书集合了侦探，惊悚和阴谋论等多种风格，并激起了大众对某些宗教理论的普遍兴趣，包括：有关圣杯的传说、抹大拉的玛丽亚（Mary Magdalene）在基督教历史中的角色等通常被基督徒视为异端的理论。虽然作者声称书中所用资料是事实，不少批评者已经指出内有极多歪曲事实和捏造之处。	<br><br>
	
此书是布朗2000年小说《天使与魔鬼》（Angels and Demons）的续篇。兰登书屋于2004年将此书再版为“特制插图版”。新版本包含了超过160幅包括文字说明的图片。	<br><br>

《维特鲁威人》（Vitruvian Man），列奥纳多・达・芬奇作。卢浮宫卓有声望的馆长雅克・索尼埃被人发现在卢浮宫的地板上被人谋杀，尸体摆出了列奥纳多・达芬奇的名画维特鲁威人的姿态，而且在身边写下一段隐秘的信息并且用自己的血在肚子上画下了五芒星的符号。	<br><br>
该书是关于主角，哈佛大学的宗教符号学教授罗伯・兰登，解决巴黎卢浮宫声望卓著的馆长雅克・索尼埃被谋杀一案。索尼埃赤裸的尸体是以列奥纳多・达・芬奇的名画维特鲁威人的姿态在卢浮宫被发现的，索尼埃死前在身边写下一段隐秘的信息并且用自己的血在肚子上画下五芒星的符号。一些达芬奇的著名作品中隐含的信息，包括《蒙娜丽莎》和《最后的晚餐》等，都在解密的过程中真相大白……	<br><br>
	
小说的主要冲突围绕着两个谜团而展开：	<br><br>
1.索尼埃保护的，最终导致他被杀害的秘密是什么？	<br><br>
2.是谁在背后策划了这一谋杀案？	<br><br>
	
小说以不同的人物同时展开几条故事线，最终所有的故事线汇集在一起，并在书的结尾得到解决。	<br><br>
	
要弄清楚迷团需要解决一系列的智力难题，包括单词中字母的排序和数字难题。谜题的真相最终指向圣杯可能出现的地点和两个分别叫做郇山隐修会（Priory of Sion）和圣殿骑士团（Knights Templar）的秘密团体。罗马天主教组织西班牙主业会（Opus Dei）也出现在情节中。	<br><br>
	
The Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery-detective novel written by Dan Brown. It follows symbologist Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris, when they become involved in a battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus having been married to Mary Magdalene. The title of the novel refers, among other things, to the finding of the first murder victim in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, naked and posed like Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing, the Vitruvian Man, with a cryptic message written beside his body and a pentagram drawn on his chest in his own blood.	<br><br>
	
The novel explores an alternative religious history, whose central plot point is that the Merovingian kings of France were descended from the bloodline of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, ideas derived from Clive Prince's The Templar Revelation (1997) and books by Margaret Starbird. The book also refers to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982) though Dan Brown has stated that it was not used as research material.	<br><br>
	
The Da Vinci Code provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and Mary Magdalene's role in the history of Christianity. The book has, however, been extensively denounced by many Christian denominations as an attack on the Roman Catholic Church, and consistently criticized for its historical and scientific inaccuracies. The novel nonetheless became a worldwide bestseller[1] that sold 80 million copies as of 2009[2] and has been translated into 44 languages. Combining the detective, thriller and conspiracy fiction genres, it is Brown's second novel to include the character Robert Langdon: the first was his 2000 novel Angels & Demons. In November 2004, Random House published a Special Illustrated Edition with 160 illustrations. In 2006, a film adaptation was released by Sony's Columbia Pictures.	<br><br>

Plot summary	<br><br>
	
Louvre curator and Priory of Sion Grand Master Jacques Saunière is fatally shot one night at the museum by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover the location of the "keystone", an item crucial to the search for the Holy Grail. After Saunière's body is discovered in the pose of the Vitruvian Man, the police summon Harvard Professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police Captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Saunière left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes a Fibonacci sequence out of order. Langdon explains to Fache that Saunière was a leading authority on the subject of goddess artwork and that the pentacle Saunière drew in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not "devil worship", as Fache says.	<br><br>
	
A police cryptographer, Sophie Neveu, secretly explains to Langdon that she is Saunière's estranged granddaughter, and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer, because her grandfather's message said "PS Find Robert Langdon", which she says Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival. Neveu is troubled by memories of her grandfather's involvement in a secret pagan group. However, she understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which she and Langdon find leads them to a safe deposit box at the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich. Neveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box they find the keystone: a cryptex, a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When these are lined up correctly, they unlock the device. If the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar ruptures and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on papyrus. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password.	<br><br>
	
Langdon and Neveu take the keystone to the house of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup, but a tomb containing the bones of Mary Magdalene. The trio then flees the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spell out Neveu's given name, "SOFIA." Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey.	<br><br>
	
During the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather, ten years earlier. Arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu clandestinely witnesses a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather's country estate. From her hiding place, she is shocked to see her grandfather having sex with a woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who are wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess. She flees the house and breaks off all contact with Saunière. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient ceremony known as Hieros gamos or "sacred marriage".	<br><br>
	
By the time they arrive at Westminster Abbey, Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working. Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing that Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and bore children, in order to ruin the Vatican. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve the second cryptex's password, which Langdon realizes is "APPLE." Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its contents before destroying it in front of Teabing. Teabing is arrested by Fache, who by now knows that Langdon was innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, he assumes that they are there to kill him, and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas was found dead later from a bullet wound.	<br><br>
	
The final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon to Rosslyn Chapel, whose docent turns out to be Neveu's long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu's long-lost grandmother. It is revealed that Neveu is a descendant of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible threats to her life.	<br><br>
	
The real meaning of the last message is that the Grail is buried beneath the small pyramid directly below the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. It also lies beneath the "Rose Line," an allusion to "Roslyn." Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle in the last pages of the book, but he does not appear inclined to tell anyone about this.	<br><br>

The Lost Symbol is a 2009 novel written by American writer Dan Brown.[2][3] It is a thriller set in Washington, D.C., after the events of The Da Vinci Code, and relies on Freemasonry for both its recurring theme and its major characters.[4]	<br><br>
	
Released on September 15, 2009, it is the third Brown novel to involve the character of Harvard University symbologist Robert Langdon, following 2000's Angels & Demons and 2003's The Da Vinci Code.[2] It had a first printing of 6.5 million (5 million in North America, 1.5 million in the UK), the largest in Doubleday history. On its first day the book sold one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the U.S., the UK and Canada, making it the fastest selling adult novel in history.[5] It was number one on the New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover fiction[6] for the first six weeks of its release,[7] and remained on the list for 29 weeks. As of January 2013, there were 30 million copies in print worldwide.	<br><br>
Plot	<br><br>
	
Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is invited to give a lecture at the United States Capitol, with the invitation apparently from his mentor, a 33rd degree Mason named Peter Solomon, who is the head of the Smithsonian Institution. Solomon has also asked him to bring a small, sealed package which he had entrusted to Langdon years earlier. When Langdon arrives at the Capitol, however, he learns that the invitation he received was not from Solomon, but from Solomon's kidnapper, Mal'akh, who has left Solomon's severed right hand in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda in a recreation of the Hand of Mysteries. Mal'akh then contacts Langdon, charging him with finding both the Mason's Pyramid, which Masons believe is hidden somewhere underground in Washington D.C., and the Lost Word, lest Solomon be executed.	<br><br>
	
Langdon is then met by Trent Anderson, head of the Capitol police, and Inoue Sato, the head of the CIA's Office of Security. Sato claims that Mal'akh poses a threat to the national security of the US, and that his capture is more important than Peter's rescue, although she refuses to elaborate. Examining Solomon's hand, they discover a clue leading them to Solomon's Masonic altar in a room in the Capitol's sub-basement, where they find a small pyramid lacking a capstone, with an inscription carved into it.	<br><br>
	
Sato then confronts Langdon with the security x-ray taken of his bag when he entered the Capitol, which reveals a smaller pyramid in the package Langdon brought in response to the request by the kidnapper posing as Solomon. Langdon explains that he was unaware of its contents, but Sato, dissatisfied with this, attempts to take Langdon into custody. Before she can arrest him, however, she and Anderson are assaulted by Warren Bellamy, the Architect of the Capitol and a Freemason, who then flees with Langdon during the melee. He later explains to Langdon that he too has been in contact with Mal'akh, and wants Langdon's assistance in rescuing Peter.	<br><br>
	
Mal'akh is revealed to be a Freemason with tattoos covering almost his entire body. He infiltrated the organization in order to obtain an ancient source of power,[9] which he believes Langdon can unlock for him in return for Peter Solomon's life. Several chapters also delve into Mal'akh's history with Peter Solomon: many years ago, Peter bequeathed a large sum of inheritance money to his rebellious son, Zachary, who then fled the Solomon household and led a reckless life in Europe until he was arrested and imprisoned in Turkey for smuggling drugs. Peter flew to Turkey, but decided to have Zachary extradited in a week's time instead of getting him out immediately in order to teach him a lesson, but apparently, Zachary was murdered by his cellmate, who got his hands on Zachary's fortune and fled to Greece to lead a luxurious life under the name Andros Dareios. Dareios, however, soon grew tired of his life. Apparently having spoken with Zachary about Solomon's life as a Mason, Dareios broke into Solomon's home to find the pyramid, but accidentally killed Peter's mother, Isabel, and was in turn shot and left to fall into a frozen river by a vengeful Solomon himself. Surviving the fall, Dareios nursed himself back to health, covered his scars and eventually his entire body with tattoos and set off on a mission to infiltrate the Freemasons and gain access to their secrets, adopting the name Mal'akh.	<br><br>
	
As Langdon deals with the events into which he has been thrust, Mal'akh destroys the Smithonsonian-sponsored laboratory of Dr. Katherine Solomon, Peter's younger sister, where she has conducted experiments in Noetic Science, in the process ambushing and almost killing Katherine in a cat-and-mouse chase, but Katherine manages to escape and meet up with Langdon and Bellamy. Mal'akh then destroys all of Katherine's research. Eventually, when cornered by the authorities, Bellamy is forced to give himself up while Langdon and Katherine escape. Both are later apprehended by Sato's team. Following clues regarding Mal'akh's previous identity as Peter Solomon's psychiatrist, Dr. Christopher Abaddon, Sato allows Langdon and Katherine rush to his mansion to confront him, but Mal'akh ambushes them and murders their CIA escort. Meanwhile, as he is being interrogated by Sato, Bellamy expresses belief that Sato is working with Mal'akh, but Sato assures Bellamy that she is also pursuing Mal'akh in the interests of national security, and displays a piece of evidence that visibly shocks Bellamy.	<br><br>
	
Mal'akh places Langdon into an airtight sensory deprivation tank, where he interrogates Langdon by slowly filling the tank with liquid. He is able to convince Langdon to unlock the code at the Pyramid's base, but continues to fill the tank until Langdon apparently drowns. Mal'akh then ties Katherine to a chair and inserts an open-ended transfusion needle into her arm, and leaves her to bleed to death, and then flees with a weakened and wheelchair-bound Peter Solomon to the Temple Room of the Scottish Rite's House of the Temple. He uses the threat of not calling an ambulance for Katherine as further coercion for Peter's cooperation. Sato leads a team of agents to the mansion after Langdon and Katherine's escort fails to check in, and are able to save Katherine's life. Langdon is revealed to have survived, due the "water" in the tank actually being breathable oxygenated liquid, and the tank being a device for meditation. Sato, Langdon, and Katherine race to the House of the Temple where Mal'akh threatens to release a heavily edited video showing government officials performing secret Masonic rituals (the same video that Sato showed to Bellamy), which without context, appears highly disturbing. Mal'akh forces the Word―the circumpunct―out of Peter and tattoos it on his head on the last portion of unmarked skin on his body. Mal'akh then orders Peter to sacrifice him, as he believes that it is his destiny to become a demonic spirit and lead the forces of evil. When Peter claims that he will do so without hesitation to avenge his son and mother, Mal'akh shocks Peter by revealing that he is actually Zachary Solomon himself, having conspired with the prison warden to fake his death by disfiguring the body of another inmate beyond recognition (at the same time, Langdon, Katherine and Bellamy discover several photos of Zachary in Greece after his supposed death that show his gradual transformation into Mal'akh). Tears in his eyes, Peter prepares to stab Zachary, but ultimately cannot bring himself to do so, and drops the knife just as Langdon arrives and tackles him. Director Sato arrives at the Temple in a helicopter, which smashes the Temple's overhead glass panel, the shards of which fatally impale Zachary. The CIA then thwart Zachary's plan to transmit the video to several leading media channels using an EMP blast, disabling a cell tower in the network path leading from Zachary's laptop computer. Langdon and Katherine then share a tearful reunion with Peter, and mourn Zachary's death. Zachary, in soul form, is only briefly able to lament his body's mutilation before he is presumably dragged down to Hell.	<br><br>
	
Later on, Peter informs Langdon that the circumpunct Zachary tattooed on his head is not the Word. He also informs Katherine that made back-ups of all of her noetic research data on his own computer, meaning her research can continue. Deciding to take Langdon to the true secret behind the Word, Peter leads him to the room atop the Washington Monument and tells him that the Word―a common Christian Bible, the Word of God―lies in the Monument's cornerstone, buried in the ground beneath the Monument's staircase. Langdon realizes that the symbols on the pyramid's base spelled out the words Laus Deo which translate to Praise God. These words are inscribed upon the small aluminum capstone atop the Monument, which is the true Masonic Pyramid.	<br><br>
	
Peter tells Langdon that the Masons believe that the Bible is an esoteric allegory written by humanity, and that, like most religious texts around the globe, it contains veiled instructions for harnessing humanity's natural God-like qualities―similar to Katherine's Noetic research―and is not meant to be interpreted as the commands of an all-powerful deity. This interpretation has been lost amid centuries of scientific skepticism and fundamentalist zealotry. The Masons have (metaphorically) buried it, believing that, when the time is right, its rediscovery will usher in a new era of human enlightenment.	<br><br>
Film	<br><br>
	
Following the worldwide successes of The Da Vinci Code in 2006[38] and Angels & Demons in 2009,[39] which were both based on Dan Brown's novels, starred Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon and produced and directed by Ron Howard, Columbia Pictures began production on a film adaptation of The Lost Symbol.[40][41] Hanks and Howard were expected to return for the film adaptation of The Lost Symbol, along with the franchise's producers Brian Grazer and John Calley. Sony Pictures eventually hired three screenwriters for the project, beginning with Steven Knight[42] and then hiring Dan Brown himself.[43] In March of 2012, Danny Strong was also hired to collaborate on the adaptation.[44]	<br><br>
	
According to a January 2013 article in the Los Angeles Times the final draft of the screenplay was due sometime in February, with pre-production expected to start in the mid-2013.[8] In July 2013 Sony Pictures announced they would instead adapt Inferno for a December 18, 2015 release date with Ron Howard as director, David Koepp adapting the screenplay and Tom Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon.[	<br><br>

故事情节 	<br><br>
	
哈佛大学教授罗伯特・兰登在一间医院的病床上醒来，头部有伤，对过去几天发生的事情完全失去了记忆。他最后的记忆是在哈佛校园内，但是很快意识到自己现在身处意大利佛罗伦萨。一位医生西恩娜・布鲁克斯告诉罗伯特他受到枪击被送到医院，所幸仅被子弹擦伤，但仍然因脑震荡而出现短时失忆。突然，一名一直跟踪兰登的女刺客瓦任莎闯入医院，枪杀了负责治疗兰登的马可尼医生，然后冲向罗伯特的病房。西恩娜迅速带兰登逃离医院前往她自己的公寓。	<br><br>
	
在西恩娜的公寓中，失忆的罗伯特听她描述了自己受伤被送往医院的细节。他在自己的外套中发现一个标有生物性危害标志的金属圆筒，于是决定求助美国领事馆。领事馆工作人员在电话中表示正在寻找罗伯特的下落，希望他能提供自己所处的位置。在西恩娜的建议下，罗伯特向领事馆提供了她公寓对面的一家宾馆的地址，以免她被进一步卷入事件当中。很快，罗伯特就看到全副武装的瓦任莎赶到他向领事馆提供的地址。二人在此刻意识到，美国政府想要除掉罗伯特。	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 罗伯特决定将金属圆筒打开。圆筒中是一个中世纪的骨质滚筒印章，印章中嵌入了一支高科技激光指示笔，并投影出了桑德罗・波提切利根据但丁・阿利吉耶里的《神曲》所创作的《地狱图》的图案。图案在原作上有所修改，底部有一行小字：“只有通过死亡之眼才能瞥见真相。”（原文为意大利文："la verità è visibile solo attraverso gli occhi della morte."）突然间，一群武装士兵突袭了西恩娜的公寓楼，二人侥幸逃脱了追捕。	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 	
 	
	
	
 罗伯特和西恩娜判断圆筒中的物品和但丁有密切联系，于是赶往佛罗伦萨老城。然而二人在路上却发现佛罗伦萨警方和意大利国家宪兵已经封锁了通往老城的道路，并开始搜寻这二人的行踪。他们于是跑进波波里花园旁边的一个建筑工地中躲藏起来，此时罗伯特仔细察看了修改过的《地狱图》，注意到其中隐藏的十个字母，依次连接起来是“CATROVACER”。十个字母分别写在图案中地狱的每一层中，但层的顺序被打乱了。根据波提切利的原图重新排列为正确顺序后，十个字母拼成“CERCA TROVA”的字样。罗伯特认出这一短语意为“去寻找，就会发现”，正是乔尔乔・瓦萨里所作壁画《马西阿诺之战》中出现的字样。这幅壁画现藏于佛罗伦萨旧宫，罗伯特和西恩娜二人最终避开士兵的搜查，穿过瓦萨利走廊进入位于佛罗伦萨老城的旧宫。	<br><br>
	
到达旧宫后，罗伯特站在《马西阿诺之战》壁画前，试图找出“死亡之眼”、被人修改过的《地狱图》和他所在位置的联系。一位管理员看到罗伯特形迹可疑，于是找到了旧宫的艺术与文化总监玛塔・阿尔瓦雷茨。玛塔认出了罗伯特，她曾在前一天晚上见到他和主教座堂博物馆馆长伊格纳奇奥・布索尼一同来到旧宫。她带领罗伯特和西恩娜二人登上壁画旁的阶梯，罗伯特意识到阶梯最高层恰好和壁画中的“CERCA TROVA”字样在同一高度。玛塔向二人提到曾在前一晚展示了但丁的死亡面具，面具就收藏在壁画旁的馆厅内，已经亿万富翁、天才遗传学家贝特朗・佐布里斯特买下，但仍放在展厅中展览。罗伯特意识到自己在前一晚已经对谜团有了线索，现在正在重新寻找当时的发现。玛塔将罗伯特和西恩娜二人带到面具所在的展厅，却发现面具不翼而飞。在查看了监控录像后，众人发现正是罗伯特和伊格纳奇奥在前一晚偷走了面具。博物馆安保人员擒住罗伯特和西恩娜，而玛塔立刻向伊格纳奇奥的办公室打电话，想要质问他面具的下落，但办公室内接听电话的秘书却告知她伊格纳奇奥已因心脏病突发而逝世。他逝世前给罗伯特留下了一则留言，秘书为罗伯特播放了留言，留言中伊格纳奇奥称自己将面具藏在某地，并暗示他道“天堂，二十五”。	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 罗伯特和西恩娜二人最终逃脱了安保人员，但追捕他们的武装士兵也赶到了现场。二人穿过五百人大厅的天顶壁画《科西莫一世成圣》上方的阁楼试图逃离，不巧瓦任莎也追到阁楼，西恩娜在斗争中将她推下阁楼杀害，二人于是成功逃离。逃跑的路上，西恩娜向罗伯特介绍了面具的主人佐布里斯特，他认为地球的人口数已经超出控制，并且主张人类应当暂停人口的增长。此外，还有传言表明佐布里斯特正在研制一种特殊的病毒以减少地球人口的增长。二人越发意识到事态的严重性，而目前发生的各种暗示都指向佐布里斯特的瘟疫病毒。罗伯特认为“天堂，二十五”是指《神曲・天堂篇》第二十五章，并由此破解出但丁的死亡面具就藏在曾为但丁举行洗礼仪式的佛罗伦萨圣若望洗礼堂。二人赶到洗礼堂找到了面具，同时发现面具背后有一串佐布里斯特写下的谜语。这时，一位名叫乔纳森・费里斯的男子闯入洗礼堂，称自己由世界卫生组织派来帮助二人逃离士兵追捕。男子面部有严重的皮疹，而胸口的皮肤也有一片淤青藏在衬衣下。三人根据谜语的提示前往威尼斯，费里斯在路上接了一个电话后对二人态度似乎出现变化。到达威尼斯之后，罗伯特根据在圣马可大教堂获得的线索推断事件与恩里科・丹多洛之墓有关。费里斯突然晕倒失去知觉，西恩娜称他已经严重内出血，罗伯特因此怀疑他已经感染了佐布里斯特的瘟疫。随后罗伯特被一群黑衣士兵擒获，而西恩娜则得以逃脱。	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 罗伯特被捕后被人带到世界卫生组织总干事伊丽莎白・辛斯基的面前，伊丽莎白随后向他解释了各种事件的真相：佐布里斯特已于一周前自杀，这位天才遗传学家痴迷于但丁，并可能已经研发出一种新型瘟疫病毒，以消灭地球上的大量人口，迅速解决地球人口过多的现状。伊丽莎白打开佐布里斯特生前留下的保险箱，发现了这支金属圆筒，并将罗伯特带到佛罗伦萨，希望他能破解真相。然而，罗伯特在第一次见到玛塔和伊格纳奇奥之后便与伊丽莎白失去联系，世界卫生组织担心他已经背叛到敌方帮助佐布里斯特释放病毒，因而派出应急反应部队搜寻他的下落。追捕他的士兵事实上就是这些部队，但这些士兵从未意图杀害罗伯特。	<br><br>
	
	
佐布里斯特事先已经雇用了一个地下组织“财团”帮助他保护金属圆筒，并希望财团在他死后将圆筒交给伊丽莎白。他还制作了一段恐怖的视频要求财团在一特定日期发布给媒体，视频中充斥着与但丁相关的元素，还拍摄了培养中即将释放的瘟疫病毒。病毒被藏在某个水下的秘密地点，外面的袋子正在缓慢溶解。视频声称世界将在第二天“永远改变”。伊丽莎白私自取走金属圆筒之后，财团只得派出团队保护圆筒的秘密。他们在罗伯特与玛塔和伊格纳奇奥见面后将他绑架，然而罗伯特当时并未破解出全部谜团。他们给罗伯特服下苯二氮平类药物，抹去了他的短期记忆，在他头上伪造了一处伤口，并导演了整个事件，以迫使罗伯特解开全部谜团。西恩娜、瓦任莎和费里斯都是财团的演员，给美国领事馆的电话也是事先安排伪造的。然而财团领导人“教务长”在看到佐布里斯特的视频后意识到事件与生物恐怖主义有关，于是一反之前与佐布里斯特的协议，同意与世界卫生组织合作。费里斯的皮疹与病毒也并无关联，只是饰演被瓦任莎枪杀的医生时使用的胶水引起的过敏反应，胸口的瘀伤也并非内出血，而是假扮被枪击时胸口的炸药故障导致的肋骨骨折。在罗伯特前往威尼斯途中时，教务长已经与伊丽莎白展开合作，并命令费里斯阻止西恩娜的行动。到达威尼斯后，西恩娜意识到费里斯正在与她作对，因而在他晕倒后袭击了他的伤口以使他暂时昏迷。	<br><br>
	
 西恩娜此时已经与财团背道而驰，财团也意识到她其实是佐布里斯特的秘密信徒和情人。罗伯特解开谜团时仍不知道这一点，于是在被捕前告诉了她瘟疫病毒的藏匿地点。西恩娜于是找到一架私人飞机，希望在众人发现之前赶到病毒所在处。另一边，罗伯特与世界卫生组织和财团合作，力求在她赶到之前阻止她。根据佐布里斯特留下的视频，众人推断出装有病毒的袋子应该在视频中标注的日期彻底溶解释放出病毒。罗伯特根据佐布里斯特的线索得出病毒应该藏在位于土耳其伊斯坦布尔圣索菲亚大教堂的恩里科・丹多洛之墓，但抵达圣索菲亚大教堂之后才发现病毒实际藏在了伊斯坦布尔的地下水宫殿。众人赶到地下水宫殿时发现西恩娜已经先于他们到达，装有病毒的袋子也已经破裂，病毒估计已经通过游客扩散开来。西恩娜被罗伯特发现后用土耳其语对游客大喊，在现场制造骚乱。游客蜂拥逃离现场，使得世界卫生组织封闭隔离的努力宣告失败。罗伯特也飞身追赶逃跑的西恩娜。	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 然而随后证实西恩娜并未刺破病毒袋，袋子本身已经于一周前溶解在地下水宫殿的水池中，病毒早已扩散，而视频中标注的日期实际是佐布里斯特根据数学计算预计病毒扩散到全球的日期。而西恩娜也是试图阻止病毒释放出来，但是并不信任世界卫生组织。她担忧政府获得病毒后将利用其制造生物武器，所以便自己独立行动。财团领导人教务长被世界卫生组织控制，他试图逃脱却最终被土耳其警方逮捕。财团将接受调查，名声毁于一旦。西恩娜获得特赦，交换条件是她将与世界卫生组织合作，利用自己的医学知识和与佐布里斯特合作研究的经历解决危机。	<br><br>
	
佐布里斯特制造的瘟疫病毒事实上是一种病毒载体，会将所载有的DNA随机植入感染者的体内，导致1/3的人类失去生育能力。但因现有的基因技术限制，试图恢复这段被修改的基因将可能导致更加灾难性的后果。人类因此被迫进入了全新的时代。	<br><br>

 Inferno is a 2013 mystery thriller novel by American author Dan Brown and the fourth book in his Robert Langdon series, following Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code and The Lost Symbol.[1] The book was released on May 14, 2013.	<br><br>
	
 Plot 	<br><br>
	
Harvard University professor Robert Langdon wakes up in a hospital with a head wound and no memory of the last few days. His last memory is walking on the Harvard campus, but he quickly realizes that he is now in Florence. Sienna Brooks, one of the doctors tending to him, tells him he suffered a concussion from being grazed by a bullet and had stumbled into the emergency ward. Suddenly, Vayentha, a female assassin who has been following Robert, breaks into the hospital, shoots the doctor in charge of Robert's care, and approaches Robert's room. Sienna grabs Robert and they flee to her apartment.	<br><br>
	
After Sienna recounts the details of his admission to hospital, Robert finds a cylinder with a biohazard sign in his jacket and decides to call the U.S. consulate. He is told that they are searching for him and want his location. Per Sienna's guidance, Robert gives them a location across the street from Sienna's apartment to avoid getting Sienna more involved in his mysterious situation than she already is. Soon, Robert sees an armed Vayentha pull up to the location Robert gave the consulate. At this point Sienna and Robert believe the U.S. government wants to kill him.	<br><br>
	
Robert decides to open the container and finds a small medieval bone cylinder fitted with a hi-tech projector that displays a modified version of Botticelli's Map of Hell. At the bottom of the illumination are the words "The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death." Suddenly, soldiers raid Sienna's building; Sienna and Robert narrowly escape.	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 Robert and Sienna head toward the Old City, believing the cylinder must have something to do with Dante. However, they find that Florentine police and Carabinieri officers have sealed the bridges and are searching for them. They run into a construction site near the Boboli Gardens where Robert illuminates the modified "Map of Hell" again, notices that individual letters, which collectively spell "CATROVACER," have been added to each of the ten layers of the Malebolge, and that the layers have been rearranged. Moving them back to the order in the original Botticelli "Map of Hell" yields the words "CERCA TROVA". Robert recognizes these are the same words on the painting The Battle of Marciano by Vasari, located in the Palazzo Vecchio. Robert and Sienna manage to evade the soldiers and get into the Old City using the Vasari Corridor.	<br><br>
	
Robert stands in front of The Battle of Marciano trying to figure out where to go next by connecting the "eyes of death" phrase in the modified "Map of Hell" with his location. A custodian sees Robert snooping around and gets the director of the museum in the Palazzo Vecchio, Marta Alvarez. Marta recognizes Robert, having met him and Ignazio Busoni, the director of Il Duomo, the previous night. She leads Robert and Sienna up a set of stairs by The Battle of Marciano, and Robert realizes the top of the stairs is on the same level as the words "cerca trova" in the The Battle of Marciano painting. Marta tells Robert that she showed them Dante's death mask the previous night, which sits in a room down the hall from the Battle of Marciano painting. Robert realizes he is retracing his own steps from the previous night. Marta takes Robert and Sienna to the mask who find that it's gone. They look at security footage and see Robert himself and Ignazio stealing the mask. The museum guards turn on Robert and Sienna. At this moment, Marta calls Ignazio's office to question him but is greeted by his secretary, who informs Marta that Ignazio died of a heart attack the other night but left a message for Robert moments before he died. Ignazio's secretary asks to speak with Robert and plays to him Ignazio's message. In it Ignazio esoterically tells Robert where the mask is hidden, referring to "Paradise 25."	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 Robert and Sienna escape the guards, but the soldiers arrive. They cross the attic over the Apotheosis of Cosimo I, where Sienna pushes Vayentha to her death. Robert connects the phrase "Paradise 25" to the Florence Baptistry, where he and Sienna find the Dante mask along with a riddle from its current owner, a billionaire geneticist named Bertrand Zobrist. Sienna later explains that Zobrist was a geneticist who advocated the halting of humanity's growth, due to its out of control population. And that he was rumored to be working on a means to do so using an engineered disease. A man named Jonathan Ferris, with a large bruise on his chest which he hides from the two, and a severe rash on his face, claiming to be from the World Health Organization (WHO), comes and helps them escape the soldiers. They follow the riddle to Venice, where Ferris suddenly falls unconscious, with Sienna claiming he is suffering from massive internal bleeding, causing Langdon to suspect Ferris has been infected with Zobrist's plague. Robert is captured by a group of black-clad soldiers while Sienna escapes.	<br><br>
	
Robert is taken to Elizabeth Sinskey, the director-general of the WHO, and is given an explanation of what is going on: Zobrist, who committed suicide the week before, was a brilliant geneticist and Dante fanatic who has supposedly developed a new biological plague that will kill off a large portion of the world's population in order to quickly solve the problem of the world's impending overpopulation, citing the Doomsday Argument. Elizabeth raided Zobrist's safe deposit box, found the cylinder, and flew Robert to Florence to follow the clues. However, Robert stopped communicating with Elizabeth after meeting with Marta and Ignazio, and the WHO feared he betrayed them and was working with Zobrist to unleash the plague. The soldiers were the WHO's emergency response team and never meant to kill Robert.	<br><br>
	
Zobrist had paid a shadowy consulting group called The Consortium to protect the cylinder until a certain date. He also left a disturbing video filled with Dante imagery, which also showed a picture of the plague itself, kept in a hidden underwater location, within a slowly dissolving bag. The video claims that the world will be changed the following morning. When Elizabeth took it away, they were obligated to protect whatever the bone cylinder pointed to. They kidnapped Robert after the meeting with Marta and Ignazio, but Robert hadn't yet solved the whole riddle. They gave Robert benzodiazepine drugs to erase his short-term memory, created a fake head wound, and staged every event up to this point so that Robert would be motivated to solve it. Sienna, Vayentha, and Ferris are all actors working for The Consortium; the call to the U.S. consulate was also staged. The leader of The Consortium, having become aware of the bioterrorism plot, has agreed to cooperate with the WHO. Ferris's rash was due to an allergic reaction to the spirit gum he used as part of the disguise as the doctor Vayentha "murdered". His bruises were because the squib used to simulate him being shot in the chest misfired and broke his ribs. He collapsed in Venice because he had been ordered to detain Sienna, as the Provost (Consortium head) had allied with Sinskey, with Sienna realizing and punching him in his damaged ribs.	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 Sienna goes rogue, and The Consortium realizes she was a secret supporter and lover of Zobrist. She learned where the plague is being kept after Robert solved the riddle and acquires a private jet to get to it before everyone else. Robert, the WHO, and The Consortium, team up to stop her. From watching Zobrist's video they conclude that the bag containing the plague will be fully dissolved by the date the video specifies, and that Zobrist's clues point to its location: the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, where Enrico Dandolo is buried. Robert and the others find the plague is in the Cistern, but discover that Sienna is already there. The bag that held the plague had already been broken, presumably spreading through the outer world via visiting tourists. Sienna runs out of the Cistern yelling something in Turkish, which causes panic among the tourists who stampede out into the city, while Langdon gives chase.	<br><br>
	
	
 	
	
	
 It is discovered Sienna didn't puncture the bag; it was water soluble and had dissolved one week previously in the Cistern waters, meaning that the whole world has already been infected. The date specified in Zobrist's video was the mathematical calculation of when the entire world would be infected. It is also discovered that Sienna was trying to stop the virus herself, but didn't trust the WHO because samples of the virus would certainly find their way into the hands of governments performing weapons research. The leader of The Consortium tries to escape WHO custody with help from disguised underlings, but is caught later by Turkish police. It is implied that The Consortium will be investigated and ruined. Sienna receives amnesty in exchange for working with the WHO to address the crisis, since she is a medical doctor and has extensive knowledge of Zobrist's research and work.	<br><br>
	
The plague that Zobrist created is revealed to be a vector virus that randomly activates to employ DNA modification to cause sterility in 1/3 of humans. Even with future genetic engineering technology, changing the human genome back would be hazardous. The human race, therefore, has been forced into a new age.	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T17">丹布朗最好的作品</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
提起丹布朗，人们总会自然地想起《达芬奇密码》，《达芬奇密码》风靡全球的成功让丹布朗的其他作品与之相比都黯然失色，再加上丹布朗出道之初几部不是那么成功的作品更加加深了人们对此的印象。但是在我个人看来，《天使与魔鬼》才是丹布朗最成功的作品。《达芬奇密码》更注重名词概念的专业性，更强调兰登在冒险过程中对符号学的解答和对宗教的解读，虽然悬念迭起，疑窦丛生，但是对于没有专业知识的读者，特别是不信奉基督教的中国读者来讲，过于去反复纠结一些基督教的专业词汇也丧失了部分读起书来的流畅性。而且就整本书的意义而言，《达芬奇密码》就像是一份冰镇可乐，你会喝的畅快淋漓，但是不及《天使与魔鬼》这样一杯清茶让你回味无穷。《天使与魔鬼》并没有把写作重点放在解答难题的过程中与兰登的历险过程，而是通过反复探讨科学与宗教这一看似互相矛盾的主题，去更深层次地去探讨人性与神性，科学与宗教。引人深省，让人深思。 	<br><br>
《天使与魔鬼》虽然有着更多作者的思考，但是整本书的情节流畅、内容丰富，通过丹布朗独特的穿插的叙述手法和反复的内心自我探讨，逐渐揭露最后的真相。光照会的四大元素“earth、air、fire、water”不仅暗藏线索，而且互相关联，让此书的解密过程更具有连续性和缜密性。 	<br><br>
此书最经典的地方还是在于人性与神性的探讨。列奥维多维特勒对于宗教有着自己独特的解读，他既相信科学的真理，却又是一个虔诚的宗教徒，他始终认为科学的最终目的只是为了证明上帝的存在。他用自己天才的头脑创造了反物质这样一个可以证明上帝创世纪的奇迹，却也创造了可以毁灭世界的恶魔。他始终坚信自己是天选之子，自己的发明会给人类带来最终福音，他既虔诚却又带有偏执，他苦心积虑的为宗教奉献自己的一切，不惜过着离群索居的生活，却最终导致了一场灾难的发生。不知道在天国的他看到自己的发明造成的人间悲剧，会不会对自己疯狂的偏执感到悔恨？ 	<br><br>
科勒，欧核中心的主任，也同样是个悲剧的人物。因为自己父母虔诚但又愚昧的宗教信仰，变得终生残疾，或许这也是他憎恨宗教的导火索。虽然科勒出场的戏份不多，但是他递给兰登的摄影机给大家解答了许多隐藏的真相。或许当他颤颤巍巍地把证明一切的摄像机递给兰登的一刹那，支撑他的也是一种信仰吧。 	<br><br>
卡洛文特斯克教皇内侍是本书最富争议的一个人物。他对于宗教有着极其的虔诚和狂热，虔诚至迂腐，狂热至愚昧。他憎恨让人类变得道德败坏、信仰缺失的科学，他痛恨想要改革宗教的教皇，甚至不惜对自己的生父教皇痛下杀手，只因他“玷污”了宗教的纯净。但是当一切真相大白之后，他又通过熊熊的烈火维护了宗教的伟大，通过自我牺牲来进行最后的赎罪，当他的身影随风泯灭在世人面前时，他在天国绽放出了笑容。虽然有着诸多的罪恶，但是当他自我救赎的那一刻，天国里的父亲――前任教皇，或许已经原谅了他。 	<br><br>
科学无疑是伟大的，让我们心里畏惧的奇迹一个个被征服，曾经不敢想象的事情一个个变成事实，但是当我们享受科技带来的便利时，却也丧失了许多伟大的东西。科技让事物越来越精细化，却也将我们越来越分离化。我们的交流通信越来越便利，可是我们却感到越来越孤单；我们可以通过网络与世界相连，可是我们面对面时却只会低头玩弄着电子产品；我们可以在虚拟世界里尽情享乐，却不愿给爱着我们的人一个微笑。我们的世界发展的太快，以至于我们不能停留半刻去思索自己的行为。我们不断地大步前进，同时也不断地发展可以毁灭世界的武器；我们不断地努力成功，同时也不断地丧失道德和信仰；我们不断地获取新的知识，同时也不断地收货挫折感和挫败感。当物质生活越来越丰富的时候，我们也比以往都更需要精神力量，当我们越来越感到空虚的时候，或许宗教可以给我们带来心理的慰藉。人性与神性永远可以并存，科学与宗教也绝非对立。或许这也是《天使与魔鬼》想要表达的吧！ 	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T18">《天使与魔鬼》影评</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
想2006年丹.布朗的《达芬奇密码》刚上映，那电影院火爆的跟1949举国同庆一样，成都比较大影院都已经卖光了票，抢都抢不到。有一部分人是并没有之前看过丹.布朗原著的，单凭想看这部片子而去看片子，所以当好多人走出影院给我回馈的时候，很多不着点，很多人甚至看不懂。想我是看过丹.布朗所有名著的人，而《达芬奇密码》的英文本和中文译本更是看过45678遍，算是相当了解，于是实在忍不住馋虫作祟，翘课去看了电影，并在电影途中用笔记本记下了与原著不同的13个地方……	<br><br>
	
时值今日《天使与魔鬼》上映我是没赶上首映，昨天兴冲冲捧着笔记本准备做记录，但结果让人有点失望，让人掏出笔记本做笔记的兴致都没有了。本着影片本身背景交代不很清楚不说，单是把原著改的乱七八糟就让人大跌眼镜。如果你没有看过原著，请不要去看电影，如果你实在想看电影，请你先去至少看个原著的简介。	<br><br>
	
不然，相信我，你会看不懂的。（仅限看英文原版无字幕者）	<br><br>
两个半小时的影片依旧把背景介绍的不清不楚，本来关于《天使与魔鬼》的知识就很深很难懂，当然这也是为什么我是丹.布朗饭的原因之一。周边很多老外都搞不清楚究竟所谓的“光照派”究竟是什么。当然我是看过原著很多遍的人，无论是英文还是中文都已经涉猎，所以那些悬念也都不是悬念，大概也能听明白什么意思。但这确实就苦了周围的尤其是中国人，影片开头沉闷，噱头也是少的可怜，虽然到后面开始精彩一点，但这点精彩远远不够我们给的票价。除了一个宏大的故事背景，当然这个背景都还没被介绍的很清楚，其他的大家完全可以当成是一部汤姆汉克斯主演的连环杀手电影，并且动作戏码还很不足，解谜又稍显沉闷，连个大彻大悟的表情都没有。只能说验证了我早先说过的一句话，《天使与魔鬼》其实并不适合改编成电影，比《达芬奇密码》还不如。	<br><br>
	
不过看《天使与魔鬼》一上映就登上了法国排行榜首位，且一系列影响使得原著也重新上架，连《达芬奇密码》也上架了，并再次爬上销量排行榜，还是为丹.布朗开心的。现在，《天使与魔鬼》排在《博物馆2》《终结者4》和《星际迷航》之后，位列第四，丹布朗可以凭此小赚一把。	<br><br>
我对宗教有一定了解，毕竟身处在这样一个宗教复杂的环境下，对天主教的了解也有一点。丹布朗本来就是个把宗教迷的胃口吊的足足的人，听说在当年《天使与魔鬼》这本书问世的时候就遭到全球天主教以及梵蒂冈教廷的抵制，但依旧不影响现在这部电影在全球影院狂卷7.58亿美元，其中Ayelet Zure有虽然花瓶但明显胜于奥黛丽塔图在《达芬奇密码》的全程梦游的表演，还有Ewan Mcgregor这个无论是啥都迷人得像天使的小帅，非美语的口音都可以把人骨头讲酥，加上演出《加勒比海盗》( Pirates of the Caribbean )系列及《妈妈咪呀》( Mamma Mia! )的瑞典演员Stellan Skarsgard 和在《东方的承诺》( Eastern Promises )饰演俄国黑帮老大的德国演员Armin Mueller-Stahl，阵容还真是不错的。当然还是要提一下汤姆汉克斯大叔，那一头经过精心设计的发型，显得年轻了好多。	<br><br>
你从桑蒂的土冢举步，那里有个魔鬼之窟。	<br><br>
穿越古代的罗马之城，揭开了神秘的元素。	<br><br>
通往光明的路已铺就，这是神对你的考验。	<br><br>
在那崇高的历险途中，让天使来为你指路。	<br><br>
 ――通往光照派教堂	<br><br>
光照派(Illuminati)：各种自称获得上帝特别光照启示的基督教神秘主义派别的总称。如：14世纪产生于拜占庭帝国的“赫西卡派 ”（Hêsukhia）；15世纪起源于西班牙加尔默罗会和方济各会修士中的“阿隆白郎陶斯派”（Alumbrodos），后受到异端裁判所的追查，很多 人被烧死；18世纪流行于德国和欧洲的“光照会”。后者由因戈尔施塔特大学法学教授韦斯豪普特于1776年创立。主张推翻教会和国家的一切权力机构，恢复 原始的自由平等。1784年，被巴伐利亚政府禁止，成为秘密教派。罗马教廷于1817年同普鲁士、1821年同巴伐利亚先后签订协议，共同加以*和蟹*。	<br><br>
	
光照派是16世纪罗马一些有识之士为了反抗天主教会的迫害、与教会进行真理的斗争而成立的 一个秘密组织。最早的创立人中有数学家、物理学家、天文学家等。后来，越来越多著名的科学家和艺术家成为光照派成员。随着光照派的实力日渐壮大，罗马教廷 感受到了极大的威胁，他们不会容忍这样一个旨在宣扬科学、反对教会的组织继续存在。因此，罗马教廷开展了一场“肃清运动”，用残忍的杀戮和威慑手段迫使光 照派从此销声匿迹。但至今仍然有人认为，光照派并未消失，只是变得更为隐秘了。他们的成员渗入了社会的各个阶层、团体，随时准备继续向天主教会发起挑战。 《天使与魔鬼》中惊心动魄的梵蒂冈反物质爆炸事件，就与光照派有关。 	<br><br>
	
光照派最早的首脑，正是大名鼎鼎的伽利略。他非常喜爱对称物。于是另一位光照派成员――艺术大 师贝尔尼尼便为伽利略设计了一件杰作。他将16世纪时人们认为组成世界的四大元素：土（earth）、水（water）、火（fire）、气（air）以 及“光照派”（illuminati）这五个原本并非对称字的单词设计成了对称的文字，即在倒转180度之后与原来的形状一模一样的文字图案。他甚至还设 计了“光照之星”――土（earth）、水（water）、火（fire）、气（air）四个单词组成了一个完美的菱形图样，而且这个图样也是对称的！倒 转180度后，与原图形完全一样，仍然可以清晰地读出四个单词的字样。	<br><br>
	
但需要指出的是，此图并非历史上光照派的对称图案，而是丹 布朗（Dan Brown）为了完成《天使与魔鬼》的写作，委托他的朋友约翰 兰登（John Landen）创制的，真实的对称图案可能早已散佚。　	<br><br>
	
“光照派”是19世纪在德国巴伐利亚州组成的一个启蒙思想家团体。它的成员中包括文学巨匠歌德和哲学家海德这样声名赫赫的人物，但它存在的时间却十分短暂。在该团体形成8年之后，巴伐利亚政府取缔了所有秘密社团，迫使它结束。	<br><br>
	
尽管如此，在它存在的时代里，“光照派”吸引了大批的拥戴者和批评者。诸如美国第三任总统托马斯 杰弗逊这样的大人物曾经盛赞“光照派”秉承的道德观念，同时则有一批人指责“光照派”秘密共谋用一个世界政府取代所有的民族和国家。	<br><br>
轶事秘闻：在其高峰期，“光照派”拥有4000名成员，在大多数欧洲国家都建立了分支。	<br><br>
光照之星，里面包含了四种基本元素： 土（earth) 气（air) 火（fire) 水(water)	<br><br>
 以上资料我记得在丹布朗书里也能找到。	<br><br>
	
开场半小时都在汤姆汉克斯流利背诵“光照派”历史中度过，幸好到后来有所收敛否则真的是要让我伤心死了，美国PG-13的标准让血腥酷刑等的镜头都很少很少，与《达芬奇密码》中边抽自己边自HIGH比起来好多了。而场景方面，因为宗教问题，是主要拍摄点梵蒂冈教廷拒绝了剧组要求布景的要求，所以剧组只能在罗马部分取景然后灰溜溜回好莱坞布室内景等。但出来效果好的惊人，包括教堂尺寸远远缩小，但拍出来和真的一样，更有后来大爆炸的场面宏大，让人为之一振。	<br><br>
	
	
总的来说，除了一中年大叔絮絮叨叨宗教和一花瓶絮絮叨叨物理，除了大把大把的原著情节不见了更大把大把的情节被改编了以外，本片还是可圈可点。相比《达芬奇密码》来说，《天使与魔鬼》在无聊和听不懂这个方面已经有很大改观。加之影片配乐惊人，除去配乐肯定就是烂片一部，配乐大师Hans Zimmer和电影的特效制作团队让人置身于其中不觉时间漫长。所以不仅仅是演员比起以往的进步，美术，设计，台景，音乐等，也给本片增大了亮点。	<br><br>

《国家宝藏》National Treasure是2004年华特迪士尼影片制作的一部动作冒险电影，由乔・德特杜巴执导，尼古拉斯・凯奇、黛安・克鲁格、贾斯汀・巴萨和肖恩・宾等联袂出演。影片于2004年11月19日在美国上映 。<br><br>

本・盖茨是一个喜爱考古的冒险家。小时候祖父约翰・亚当斯・盖茨告诉他一个惊天秘密，美国的开国元勋乔治・华盛顿、托马斯・杰斐逊、本杰明・富兰克林曾在某一处埋藏着巨额财富作为战备储蓄金（涉及光明会），而宝藏的秘密就隐藏在《独立宣言》中，于是开展了一场惊心动魄的寻宝之旅。<br><br>
安吉丽娜・朱莉 (Angelina Jolie) 主演的电影《古墓丽影》(Tomb Raider)，光照派（英语：Illuminati）也是主角来的。<br><br>
《古墓丽影》（Tomb Raider）系列是由Eidos所推出的动作冒险游戏，系列第一部于1996年发行。这款的特色采用了女性角色为主角来进行冒险，游戏的成功也连带的将身材火辣、剽悍敏捷却又有着高度知性的动作派考古学家劳拉（Lara Croft）推上电玩经典角色之列。<br><br>

2001年安吉丽娜・朱莉（Angelina Jolie）主演同名电影。<br><br>

 多年前，劳拉的父亲曾跟她提到一个叫作光明会（Illuminati）的神秘组织，这个组织一直在寻找一具古钟，他们相信这具古钟是打开时间和空间的钥匙，这把钥匙是一块结晶的陨石金属所铸成的三角形神秘物体，五千年前被用来消灭他们所有的敌人。这块三角形被分成两半，只要把这两半结合为一，光明会的始祖将获得重生，人类的未来也将永远改变。四十八小时后，当行星完全排成一列，天空将出现日全蚀现象，而这时后三角的力量达到巅峰，如果错过这个时辰，就必须再等待另一个五千年。劳拉必须在短短的两天内，先到柬埔寨的吴哥，找到三角形其中的一半，然后再赶到西伯利亚的冰天雪地找到另一半。劳拉最终在四十八小时内找到神秘的三角形，并且及时拯救宇宙。<br><br>
光照派（英语：Illuminati），又被翻译为光明会或光明帮，是启蒙运动时期的一个巴伐利亚秘密组织，成立于1776年5月1日。 “光照派”通常被描绘成其成员试图阴谋幕后控制全世界。“光照派”有时也被作为“新世界秩序”的同义语。<br><br>

“光照派”的拉丁语字面意思就是“受过特别启示的人”。《依天屠龙记》也有类似光明顶波斯魔教一类的说法。<br><br>

	<b><a name="T19">《失落的秘符》 剧透</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
达芬奇密码曾是最流行的一本书，尽管大多数中国人并不深刻的信奉天主，没有西方人读完此书后的别样震撼，但是作为一本悬疑小说，它的情节和人物设计仍然让我们难以释怀。	<br><br>
	
我曾用2天的时间看完英文版，之后不久又从朋友那里借了中文版1天看完，再加上后来上映的电影也没落下。乐此不疲。	<br><br>
	
现在丹布朗又来了，他的新书the lost symbol(消失的符号)已经于最近出版，我们把一些网友对此书的评价分章节透露如下，供君先睹为快。如果您不想失去初读此书的惊诧之乐，请就此打住，静静的等待中文版发布吧。（以下内容分别来自时代周刊、时尚先生英文版，以及部分网络摘录）	<br><br>
	
前言	<br><br>
	
距离白宫很近的地方，一个邪教在策划阴谋…… 上来就是一个闷棍，没错，这是丹布朗的风格。	<br><br>
	
第1章	<br><br>
	
男1号罗伯特兰顿又来了，他在去华盛顿的路上去见一个从前的导师，被一个专写揭秘教会书籍的女士认了出来（女1号？） 这里揭露了一个逼真的丑闻，感觉像把一只狐狸丢到了养鸡场里。	<br><br>
	
几乎忘了君子门是关于时尚的了（汗），这里要特别提一下兰顿先生的行囊，老式的圆领套头毛衣和咔叽夹克？阿汤哥会不会为此不再出演兰顿了？这也太过时了。建议他从君子门“礼”频道挑选一身型男装扮，看在美丽的女1号面子上，拜托！	<br><br>
	
第2章	<br><br>
	
我们现在知道了那个邪恶的总在自言自语的家伙名叫Mal'akh（希伯来语里天使的意思），而且他是一个头上有“纹身”的天使。 	<br><br>
	
顺便介绍下纹身的概念，纹身，也做文身，又叫刺青，是用带有颜色的针刺入皮肤底层而在皮肤上制造一些图案或字眼出来。即指刺破皮肤而在创口敷用颜料使身上带有永久性花纹。在皮肤上造成隆起条纹瘢痕的作法。平纹文身在全世界大多数地区均有实行，肤色较深的民族没有这种习惯，中国近几百年间也比较少见。许多民族认为文身可以防病灾。也有的民族用文身标明地位、身份或某一集团的成员资格，但最普遍的动机大概是为了美观。也是为了表示我是黑社会或者恐怖分子，比如文一个蜡笔小新（郭德纲）。 	<br><br>
	
Mal'akh自恋的看着自己的裸体，他浑身都是文身（可惜不知道本拉登是不是有纹身），他的乳头是凤凰的双眼，双脚是鹰的爪。他不停的喃喃自语：它就埋在某个地方……	<br><br>
	
	
第3章	<br><br>
	
兰顿先生在日出前居然在游泳，5000米？他到底是教书匠还是菲尔普斯的教练？后来他见到了Peter Solomon（彼得所罗门，国王的姓氏？），这个据说是他导师的人物，Solomon是一个名叫Smithsonian组织的首脑。	<br><br>
	
第4章	<br><br>
	
我们的天使Mal'akh又来了，（很像达芬奇密码里的那个白化病人杀手？）他跑到了美国的国会山，看来是要整出点动静来。	<br><br>
	
第5章	<br><br>
	
Katherine Solomon是Peter Solomon的妹妹（和兰顿的辈分怎么论？师姨还是师婶？），是一个抽象学学者（Noetic scientist），作者说她“嫁给了科学”，突然想到了杨振宁和…… 不管怎么说，应该是兰顿欣赏的那类人，物以类聚嘛。 	<br><br>
	
剧透：Katherine居然在和Mal'akh通电话，他告诉她“找不到那个东西……”她是坏人？也许她是达芬奇密码里索菲和瘸腿老绅士的合体。	<br><br>
	
第6章	<br><br>
	
为了赶上他讲座的时间，兰顿在国会山的草坪上奔跑，我们敬爱的教授，居然带了一块米老鼠的电子手表！看来妖人布鲁诺的影响无处不在。建议他再戴一顶灰太狼的个性礼帽！ 	<br><br>
	
突然的联想：汤姆汉克斯扮演的兰顿曾经在一个哈佛的讲座中提到了华盛顿的神秘建筑，以及一个神秘组织the Freemasons（自由石匠联盟?），里面的成员包括乔治华盛顿！我觉得奥巴马健美的身材，说不定也来自于经常从事采石头这样的体力劳动！	<br><br>
	
这个联想引发了我另外一个不祥的联想，丹布朗好像眼睛也不大，他要是被韩国人拉过去，说他是韩裔的话…… 丹布朗颠覆历史的功夫完全顶的上韩国一万个棒棒了，丹布朗？丹棒棒？不敢往下想了，打住。	<br><br>
	
第7章	<br><br>
	
显然Smithsonian这个组织要收集一些宝物，目前他们只有2%，他们还需要更多的阳光、巧克力、金币，以及西瓜投手、玉米加农炮等道具，才能和僵尸们决一死战…… （本人植物大战僵尸玩多了）。	<br><br>
	
第9章	<br><br>
	
Hamistagan？这是意大利神学家蛋腚，不，是“但丁”撰写《神曲》的地方。没错，西安是张艺谋写红高粱里《酒神曲》的地方，那里还有兵马俑，那位网络写手能山寨一个悬疑的历史故事？	<br><br>
	
第10-14章	<br><br>
	
驼背、满是伤疤的双手、数不胜数的纹身，这些保安人员怎么那么像光晕3里的生化兵？他们开着豪华轿车，身上藏着武器……	<br><br>
	
第15章	<br><br>
	
我有点迷糊了，作者开始引用Rhonda Byrne的《秘密》中的理论，说“思维可以成为现实”，人类的头脑可以“远程控制”现实世界，很邪很迷信。如果谁有这种能量的话，行行好把房价打个对折如何？	<br><br>
	
第16章	<br><br>
	
兰顿误认为CIA的安全官员Inoue Sato是一个得了喉癌，移植了声带，所以声音沙哑的怪人。吸烟有害健康。	<br><br>
	
第17章 	<br><br>
	
那只残缺不全的手…… 兰顿开始解谜游戏了，他要破译5个纹身的涵义，一个王冠、一颗星星、一个太阳、一个灯笼…… 还有那个神秘之手。	<br><br>
	
第18章 	<br><br>
	
星相学的数据库，先人们把他们的发现记录在厚厚的书中，不像现在，可以百度一下搞定。还有关于科学的古怪命题：人类的思想，像物体一样，是有质量的。	<br><br>
	
第19章 	<br><br>
	
作者使用了很多斜体字，莫名其妙的地方，难道是他故意留下的一个密码？让我们把这一章里的斜体字都按顺序一一挑出来，读上去似乎是一首诗呢：	<br><br>
	
那么，你	<br><br>
说彼得会指引方向？	<br><br>
彼得会指引方向？	<br><br>
（指向）一个时空之门？	<br><br>
在那里？	<br><br>
（这是）疯狂的说法。	<br><br>
只有，你 	<br><br>
你，我的，狂人（会这样认为）	<br><br>
算了吧，彼得	<br><br>
为什么？ 	<br><br>
具体点说	<br><br>
（我）听说过	<br><br>
（一个）奇谈怪论	<br><br>
众人接受的常理未必就是真理	<br><br>
你有几周的空闲么？ 	<br><br>
可能，没有	<br><br>
隐喻、辞藻、现实	<br><br>
告诉（你）	<br><br>
这里一无所有。	<br><br>
	
第20章 	<br><br>
	
作者暗指说美国的国家基石并不是基督教徒，反而是一些异教徒，而国会山（白宫）实际上就是Vesta神庙的一个副本，在这里一些小昭一样的圣女在保护着永恒之火。没错，微软的vista也一定是异教徒的标志。	<br><br>
	
第21章 	<br><br>
	
还在国会山里，乔治华盛顿被描绘为神，雕在穹顶下的浮雕上，而富尔敦（蒸汽船的发明人）和摩尔斯（电报的发明人）则是凡人。	<br><br>
	
前文中提到过苹果iPhone手机，这里又提到了黑莓手机，很平衡嘛，最后的阴谋也离不开数码时代的烙印。	<br><br>
	
第22章 	<br><br>
	
一个假冒的心理医生告诉了Katherine他哥哥的精神状况。心理健康在国内似乎还不大受关注。	<br><br>
第23章 	<br><br>
	
世界应该保持现状，迷失在无知的黑暗中…… 	<br><br>
	
跑个题。国内有个知名的动画片《喜洋洋和灰太狼》，好像和《哈利波特》的模式很像，比如说：	<br><br>
	
聪明英俊的男一号，好学生（喜羊羊VS哈利波特）	<br><br>
	
聪明美丽的女一号，好同学（美羊羊VS赫敏），而且他们有些**感情，但绝对不会成了一对	<br><br>
	
一个有点笨但心地不错的男同学（沸羊羊VS红头发）	<br><br>
	
一个白胡子老师（村长VS校长）	<br><br>
	
一个超级牛的大反派（灰太狼VS伏地魔），但是你打骨子里就知道反派一定完蛋的，不管是多少集之后	<br><br>
	
其实丹布朗先生的作品中也有一些类似的人物模式，同样可以列举出来： 	<br><br>
	
罗伯特兰顿（汤姆汉克斯）	<br><br>
	
智力99容貌80的女一号（每集必换的丹女郎）	<br><br>
	
一个神秘组织中的邪恶人物，智力100魅力99，外表光鲜优雅，内心充满变态想法	<br><br>
	
一个恶心的恶棍，武力100智力有没有都可以	<br><br>
	
一些智力武力80左右的警察或者侦探作为很好的陪衬	<br><br>
	
要是让你猜出来情节，他就不姓丹！	<br><br>
	
第24章	<br><br>
	
iPhone在3页中出现了8次！丹布朗也开始向“流星雨”学习雷人的广告植入了？	<br><br>
	
第25章 	<br><br>
	
没有，任何，有趣，情节。	<br><br>
	
第26-27章 	<br><br>
	
Zoubianis hung up, grabbed his bowl of Pirate’s Booty, and unmated the game. Women. 	<br><br>
	
丹布朗先生，您在是出小学奥利匹克英语考题么？	<br><br>
	
本人臆测的译文如下，欢迎达人指教：Zoubianis挂上电话，抓起他那部分海盗战利品，放走了身边的猎物。那些女人们。	<br><br>
	
第29-30章 	<br><br>
	
作者说有一处“一美元样式”的大理石庙宇隐藏在华盛顿特区中的某个地方――又开始达芬奇密码、天使与魔鬼中类似的找庙情节了（我觉得更像在仙剑奇侠传中走迷宫开宝箱）。	<br><br>
	
第31章 	<br><br>
	
在这章里，通过兰顿之口，作者列出了他心目中的“正义对邪恶”的代表，包括： 	<br><br>
	
Merlin（亚瑟王故事里善良的巫师）vs. Morgan le Fay （传说中的恶女巫）	<br><br>
	
圣乔治vs. 恶龙	<br><br>
	
David（圣经中年轻的国王）vs. Goliath（David击败的邪恶武士） 	<br><br>
	
白雪公主vs. 巫师	<br><br>
	
天行者卢克vs. 死星	<br><br>
	
太西方化了，我们不妨来一个中国版本的正邪对峙	<br><br>
	
郭德纲vs. 宋祖德	<br><br>
	
国安vs. 申花	<br><br>
	
李宇春vs. 芙蓉姐姐	<br><br>
	
喜羊羊vs. 灰太狼	<br><br>
	
植物vs. 僵尸 	<br><br>
	
贾君鹏vs. 九城 	<br><br>
	
余则成vs. 胡士泰	<br><br>
	
…… 你还可以有很多自己的PK名单	<br><br>
第32章	<br><br>
	
读者在这里感觉来到了欢乐谷，像坐云霄飞车一样急坠到地底。白宫的地下居然是…… 有很多百姓都传说故宫的地下也有一座城，不过这完全是民间故事，真有人有这样的想象力编个小说，似乎也不太可能。	<br><br>
	
第33章	<br><br>
	
在走下白宫地下城的路上，建筑师Warren Bellamy告诉安全官员Mark Zoubianis说，他必须服从他的意愿……	<br><br>
	
第34章	<br><br>
	
难道这里有一只巨大的日本怪兽或者是八爪鱼？可惜，没有电影特技效果，我想象不出他的样子。	<br><br>
	
第35章	<br><br>
	
朝一扇门进攻，很像生化危机1里的情节。	<br><br>
	
第36章	<br><br>
	
在那扇被子弹打成筛子的13号门后面到底有什么呢？	<br><br>
	
一个人类的头骨、两条腿骨、古老的沙漏、水晶瓶、蜡烛、两盘白色粉末，还有一张纸（解谜的FLASH小游戏？） 	<br><br>
	
最无关痛痒的一句话是这样的：“你可以想象一下在自家卧室的衣橱里，你不知道一直都有一架骷髅”。	<br><br>
	
第37章	<br><br>
	
作者称书中一个人物为“胖妞”，还是芙蓉姐姐那个类型的。 	<br><br>
	
剧透：胖妞芙蓉姐姐被巨大的（章鱼）怪物吞掉了…… 大快人心？ 谢谢你大怪！	<br><br>
	
第38章	<br><br>
	
兰顿又开始玩填字游戏了。	<br><br>
	
第39章	<br><br>
	
无聊的一章。	<br><br>
	
第40章	<br><br>
	
在不到一页的篇幅里，丹布朗展示了他的词汇量，不同的单词体现类似的含义："不安trepidation" "不安uneasy feeling" "不安disquiet" 正在“被单词”的同学们可以好好学习下。	<br><br>
	
第41章	<br><br>
	
黑莓手机又派上用场，兰顿都惊讶说：“白宫地下这么深的地方居然还有信号！”广告怎么说来的？联通信号就是好，地上地下都覆盖！ 	<br><br>
	
有人该猜测了，也许是无线信号真的很强大，也许是美国的特工人员需要在底下也有无线信号…… 反恐24小时的思路。	<br><br>
	
第42章	<br><br>
	
纯粹剧透：兰顿被CIA抓住了，像个恐怖分子一样，但是危急时刻一个陌生的黑人朋友（威尔史密斯？）用一个骷髅武器把他救了出来，然后从白宫地下专门给特工修建的迷宫一样的地道中逃脱了。	<br><br>
	
第43章	<br><br>
	
兰顿幡然顿悟。太厉害了，男一号显然能单靠记忆画出GOOGLE EARTH的全球地图来。	<br><br>
第44章	<br><br>
	
情节是这样的，一个编辑终于答应了一名作者的要求，一个麻烦的工作，帮兰顿找到了一个电话号码。他无奈的摇了摇头说：要是没有作者也能出版书的话那该多好！太对了，要是没有记者也能发新闻稿，没有网络编辑也能发网络文章那该多好，不会有那么多版权纷争了。	<br><br>
	
第45章 	<br><br>
	
一休哥一遇到难题就要坐下来往头上画圈圈，喜羊羊一进入思考状态就要咿呀嘿，兰顿也差不多，他又要突发灵感解谜了。不过这次好痛！连大脚趾折断的声音也能激发他的灵感闪光？	<br><br>
	
第46章 	<br><br>
	
很神往的地方：美国国家图书馆：因为很多人都说这里是世界上最美的房间，所以也就让人们忽视了除了内部建筑的美，这里还有数量巨大的藏书，长达500公里的书架…… 有人说GOOGLE的“邪恶”之处，其一就是在慢慢蚕食每一个图书馆，因为越来越多的图书被扫描成图片发到网络上。希望读者在搜索 丹布朗或者 the lost symbol 的时候能够看到此文。	<br><br>
	
第47章 	<br><br>
	
Katherine的反击：强烈的光束照到了袭击她的人，2500万烛光亮度的强光几乎毁掉了他放大的瞳孔。描述的太科学了，就是把眼晃瞎了呗。	<br><br>
	
第48章 	<br><br>
	
大声的呼喊！	<br><br>
	
第49-50章 	<br><br>
	
寻宝图。	<br><br>
	
第51章 	<br><br>
	
关于Solomon家族阴谋的线索很有趣，这也是我觉得目前最吸引我的地方了，看到这里我已经用了大约6个小时。但是我不得不说丹布朗讲故事的本领并没有太大突破，也许是他参加商业活动宣传了太多的缘故吧。姚明，你也一样，商业活动要去的，但不宜过多。	<br><br>
	
第52章 	<br><br>
	
据说美国的911报警记录在满月的时候明显增多？ 	<br><br>
	
很想问兰顿，是否月亮真能让狼和人发狂。我们知道"lunatic疯子"这个词是从拉丁文"luna 月亮"而来的。	<br><br>
	
第53章 	<br><br>
	
兰顿的新朋友，来自“自由石匠联盟”的Warren Bellamy在滔滔不绝的讲述石匠联盟的历史。	<br><br>
	
第54章 	<br><br>
	
一个很爽的大爆炸！	<br><br>
	
第55章 	<br><br>
	
Bellamy开始显示出他建筑师的专业技能，他搞定了一个螺旋楼梯，结果发现又走进了另一个螺旋楼梯，简直像俄罗斯套件娃娃一样，圈子？圈套？ 	<br><br>
	
第56章 	<br><br>
	
Katherine和兰顿对视了一段时间，他们同时明白了下一个解密的方法。这时候我想以后的电影导演都不用改写剧本了，除非他想把这个PG级的电影（父母陪同观看）拍成限制级的。	<br><br>
第57章 	<br><br>
	
天使Mal'akh逃跑的路上还镇定的回忆着他的多重身份，他谋杀的很多受害者。同时他开着一辆豪华轿车，光着膀子。	<br><br>
	
第58-59章	<br><br>
	
CIA使用了一个秘密武器，别名叫Silly String，蠢绳？搞笑。	<br><br>
	
第60章 	<br><br>
	
一个保安人员到Kalorama的高地去检查情况，结果看到了黑暗中的秘密，被干掉了。	<br><br>
	
第61章 	<br><br>
	
今天晚上Warren Bellamy不是第一次被蒙上双眼了。	<br><br>
	
第62章 	<br><br>
	
With that, Katherine yanked defiantly on the twine, and the brittle wax seal exploded. Oh, give me a break. Bring on the falling anvils. ― A.T.	<br><br>
	
第63-67章 	<br><br>
	
更多的线索，更多的废话，简直就是史酷比狗狗的故事，一点也不严谨。	<br><br>
	
第68章 	<br><br>
	
Albrecht Durer的画作 Melencolia ，太复杂了，把达芬奇都比下去了。	<br><br>
	
第69章 	<br><br>
	
很像CIA的严刑拷问程序呀，难道是对丑闻的嘲讽？	<br><br>
	
第70章 	<br><br>
	
达芬奇密码	<br><br>
	
关键道具：带谜题的盒子里就是藏宝图	<br><br>
	
密码装置：需要猜出的密码（apple），里面是进一步的线索	<br><br>
	
消失的符号	<br><br>
	
关键道具：一个石头上有解谜的题目	<br><br>
	
魔法立方体装置：需要解译一个数学题目才能得到里面的线索	<br><br>
	
第71章 	<br><br>
	
很大篇幅用来描述一个没有头发的老坏蛋在洗澡，还有推油桑拿。很可怕，不过不是作者想要的那种可怕感觉……	<br><br>
	
第72章 	<br><br>
	
CIA又让兰顿跑掉了，这回？跳出警车飞奔而去。怎么变了成龙电影里的场景了？	<br><br>
	
第73章 	<br><br>
	
911后的隐喻？一个讽刺？不管怎么样，一个穆斯林的出租车司机和政府合作，希望帮助政府找到坏人。太假了，哪个出租司机在意乘客在后座干什么？	<br><br>
	
第74章 	<br><br>
	
一根烟，一个问讯人，一个拒绝，一个无效劳动。	<br><br>
	
第75章 	<br><br>
	
美元上的暗藏玩笑？丹布朗就会发现这些令人惊讶的细节，通过纸币的折叠可以显示出字母MONAS，也就是MASON：石匠！	<br><br>
	
第76章 	<br><br>
	
兰顿终于又跑掉了，他跑到了华盛顿的地铁里面。你不知道华盛顿的地铁有多糟，比你一个人在沙漠里迷了路，没有水，只有本破小说还要糟的多！	<br><br>
第77章 	<br><br>
	
这个坏人曾经是个超级杀手，后来受了伤，想用纹身遮盖伤疤，但是在研究纹身的过程中认为自己就是黑暗天使，从此走向了一条邪教之路。	<br><br>
	
第78章 	<br><br>
	
我们的英雄还能逃脱么？看上去是死路一条。	<br><br>
	
第79章 	<br><br>
	
太假了，他们居然逃出来了！	<br><br>
	
第80章 	<br><br>
	
这些CIA到底是哪边的？现在还看不出来，他们看上去像一些没头苍蝇乱跑，不过也许他们真的能帮助度过危机。 	<br><br>
	
第81章 	<br><br>
	
邪恶的Mal'akh的举动越发古怪，他开始用文身上留出的血做墨水了，看到这里我不由得打了个寒颤。	<br><br>
	
第82章 	<br><br>
	
“显然这个金字塔是个隐喻的地图，而不是一个实际的地图”兰顿说，也许他现在需要喝一杯，毕竟他已经做了那么多文字游戏了。作为读者，我也觉得需要喝一杯，毕竟我已经看完了这么多页文字了，说我一点不失望就太假了。 	<br><br>
	
第83章 	<br><br>
	
Bellamy惊讶的看着Sato，Sato也在盯着他。“我本不想告诉你这些”，她说，“但你让我别无选择。”……	<br><br>
	
你知道他们为什么这么惊讶么，他们在看“艳照”，CIA版的莱温斯基+艳照门！	<br><br>
	
第84-85章 	<br><br>
	
牛顿，又来了？	<br><br>
	
第86章 	<br><br>
	
“我必须摧毁。”	<br><br>
	
好生硬好冷酷，像不像魔鬼终结者？也许杀手Mal'akh的最佳角色人选就是现任的加州州长阿诺呢！	<br><br>
	
第87章 	<br><br>
	
一个瞎子讲一个关于瞎子的笑话……	<br><br>
	
第88-92章 	<br><br>
	
时间在一点点流逝，兰顿和Katherine还在一路狂奔，不过他们还必须花点时间在厨房里做个科学小实验。 	<br><br>
	
沸水煮过后的小金字塔在黑暗中闪闪发光，还有一个地址在上面：原来Peter Solomon还活着，尽管他失去了一只手。	<br><br>
	
第93-95章 	<br><br>
	
兰顿他们通过线索追寻到了Franklin广场，邪恶的Mal'akh把他们捉住了。Katherine被困了起来，惊险故事中女主角经常这样，兰顿必须通过他的智谋快速的把她救出来！	<br><br>
	
第96章 	<br><br>
	
在一场激烈的枪战后，Mal'akh“清点战场”。兰顿还能站立，Katherine仍旧捆倒在地，CIA的探员被击毙，血腥的场面。	<br><br>
	
第97章 	<br><br>
	
Nola Kaye告诉Sato他们要找的这个建筑是“一个不寻常的大厦”，是一个神圣而且神秘的圣域，为了维护一个古老的秘密秩序而建立。她知道的还真多，一定参考了维基百科吧。	<br><br>
	
第98章 	<br><br>
	
兰顿这时并非主角，邪恶的Mal'akh拉着Katherine进入了一个神秘的通道，还奉承她说：“我很欣赏你的科学知识，我希望你也欣赏我的能力。”	<br><br>
第99章 	<br><br>
	
这就是神秘组织在华盛顿建立的雕像了，上帝知道为什么，不过肯定没有红十字会资助的医院那么有益健康。	<br><br>
	
第100章 	<br><br>
	
兰顿在想法设法打开一个上锁的盒子，Katherine被捆在椅子上，一个满是纹身的变态狂在发表灰太狼类型的末日宣言。这就是丹布朗的最新畅销书？有点雷人。	<br><br>
	
第101章 	<br><br>
	
鸟儿还在树上熟睡，水已经没过了奶牛们的膝盖，那现在水有多深？将近1米，还在上涨…… 	<br><br>
	
第102章 	<br><br>
	
哦，这么危急的关头，居然下雨了，水越长越高。	<br><br>
	
第103章 	<br><br>
	
水深火热的情节。	<br><br>
	
第104章 	<br><br>
	
坏人莫名其妙的离开了，剩下Katherine一个人，她有足够的时间打量她被困的房间，看到一些有含义的雕像，进而猜想到这就是古人把牺牲品献给神明的方式。当然，她就是那个牺牲品。怎么越看越像80年代印第安纳琼斯里面的场景呢？	<br><br>
	
第105章 	<br><br>
	
在这个祭祀房间中，并没有什么可怕的事情发生，但是CIA的主管还是觉得的不寒而栗，然后她也“灵感突发”……	<br><br>
	
第106章 	<br><br>
	
密码破译，黑客模式	<br><br>
	
第107章 	<br><br>
	
“我想你刚刚称出了人灵魂的质量”…… 我记得有个古代科学家坚信人类的灵魂是有重量的，他把濒死人的床放在称上，据说人去世的瞬间称出的重量确实减少了。不过，我才丹布朗写完这本书他的体重一定减轻了，我不是说他累瘦了，我是说他写的自己魂飞魄散，灵魂出窍。	<br><br>
	
第108章 	<br><br>
	
如果我们有机会做个试验的话，关于人类灵魂的，得花多少时间呢？我说的可不是中世纪的巫术，比如用烧瓶把我们多彩的思维盛出来，然后检测下有没有H1N1病毒之类的？这也就需要3分钟吧。别惊讶，书里就是这么写的，效率真高，而且易如摊煎饼。	<br><br>
	
第109章 	<br><br>
	
老天，CIA、兰顿和Katherine三条线索的故事现在终于结合到一起乐，难以相信有多少读者能一心三用记着三处情节的同时进展。你试着一边吸烟一边接电话一边打麻将，要么烫了嘴熏了眼，要么电话掉地上了，要么就是点炮，这个最糟！	<br><br>
	
第110章 	<br><br>
	
好吧，我知道兰顿不能死，男一号嘛。不过这个还是太夸张了，他的灵魂、幻想、创造力、出神入化的境界、不朽，等等。这真的就是上帝的待遇了。他们相差的只有影响力，毕竟全世界有几亿人每天唱着赞美诗在歌颂上帝。	<br><br>
第111章 	<br><br>
	
没有解释？也没有查询过维基百科或者百度百科？就把找答案的工作留给专家们吧！这也太气人了，比听见我父母唱曾轶可的歌还要让我受不了。	<br><br>
	
还有，丹布朗把以前西部片或者侦探小说里独白的伎俩也用上了，也许就是为了填写内容吧。据说有人真的去搜索了下，发现一些内容可能来自《死亡诗社》Dead Poets Society（一部著名的励志电影）。网络时代，当个作家越来越容易。	<br><br>
	
第112章 	<br><br>
	
哦，原来兰顿没有淹死！因为这不是水，而是一种有机溶液，人可以在里面呼吸，想电影《深渊》的道具一样。Mal'akh，你这个笨蛋天使。 	<br><br>
	
现在我们才想到那个老侦探的自言自语，有意思。这东西据说确实存在，而且就是CIA发明的。	<br><br>
	
第113章 	<br><br>
	
赶紧，给兰顿一支笔！（不是一支笔牌的香烟，是一只写字的笔）	<br><br>
	
第114章 	<br><br>
	
喔，原来就是那个地方，那么神秘古怪的名字，我为什么没有早点想到呢？	<br><br>
	
第115章 	<br><br>
	
等等，有个隐形摄像机在……他的假发里？我晕！	<br><br>
	
第116章 	<br><br>
	
Mal'akh喃喃自语着他的拉丁文： "Verbum significatium. Verbum omnificum." 这应该是哈利波特里面的一个魔法吧，鬼知道什么意思！	<br><br>
	
第117章 	<br><br>
	
Katherine亲吻了兰顿，可惜不是热吻，呵呵。	<br><br>
	
第118-133章 	<br><br>
	
从第438页开始我就觉得不舒服了，一个暗黑天使绑架了一个失去一只手的残疾人，整个线索的高潮就是石匠联盟不让一段视频被媒体播出，看的我莫名其妙。肯定早有人把它传到YouTube上了，但是都不一定受网友关注。看来丹布朗也开始自娱自乐了。	<br><br>
	
不过这本书还是有个很大的好处的，就是看了这么多关于玄学、心理暗示的“科学”解释，我突然觉得自己的意念无所不能，不是上帝与我同在，甚至是…… 我觉得我就是上帝，就是NEO，就是救世主。兰顿自己不也相信了吗？何况他还是个科学家，无神论者。 	<br><br>
	
其实这个故事满糟糕的，上帝从天上带来个麻烦，折腾了作者、读者和兰顿一通，他老人家又自己把问题解决了。不过既然我可以认为上帝即我我即上帝，那岂不是都是我惹的祸？	<br><br>
	
尾声	<br><br>
	
白宫穹顶上，东边的太阳就要出山了，圆满的大结局。不过我仍然很好奇的想知道，那个反派的手到底怎么样了？算了，我这个罪魁祸首还是洗洗睡了吧。	<br><br>

	<hr><br>
	
	Aohara 发布于： 2012-05-15 <br><br>
他亲手创造了危机，无异于创造了神迹。	<br><br>
	
殉道者，他们内心一定过于强大，以至面对肉体苦修之彻痛毫无惧色，以肉身之痛释放灵魂的哭诉指引向媲美自虐的悲情。	<br><br>
	
只有最坚定纯粹的信仰，才会产生信仰的质疑。	<br><br>
	
对上帝的虔诚，能让他借助地狱魔鬼的法力，将地狱烈火烧红的铁印毫不犹豫地烙上自己赤裸胸膛皮肉之上。	<br><br>
	
最后他同样毅然地灵魂毫无保留地献给天父。	<br><br>
	
 	
	
我真的爱这个男人EwanMcgregor。	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
这片子跟兰登教授没啥关系，天使与恶魔的合体，点题都说的是Ewan扮演的第一反角：教皇内侍。反角比主角更耀眼。	<br><br>
	
平淡无奇的冒险情节，规规矩矩的第一主角，毫无感染力的配乐，唯独Ewan点亮了全片。	<br><br>
	
 	
	
从他刚出场问兰登教授：Do you believe in God, Sir? I did not ask you if you believe what man says about God.I asked if you believe in God.我就感觉到，他儒雅苍白的面孔后，魔鬼站在他的肩膀上，我的第一感觉，他将会是幕后大反派。	<br><br>
	
他在询问一个旁观者的答案。	<br><br>
	
 	
	
最初，他请求红衣主教正视危机，他在众红衣主教面前一番慷慨激昂：	<br><br>
	
science and religion are not enemies. 	<br><br>
	
There are simply somethings that science is just too young to understand. 	<br><br>
	
So the Church pleads, "Stop.""Slowdown.""Think. Wait." And, for this, they call us backwards.Butwho is more ignorant?	<br><br>
	
 	
	
我在想，Ewan优雅内敛的声线，是注定不适合当鼓动者。	<br><br>
	
果然，他等到否定的回答：Godanswers all prayers, but...sometimes His answer is no. 	<br><br>
	
这一次，我被他天使般的忧郁温和所迷惑,被他的无辜和沉默所迷惑。	<br><br>
	
教皇内侍，他敏感超脱，睿智果然，敢作敢为，无法满足于其他主教的软弱，他看到了光明之路，渴求改革，一心想引领教会走向真理。他的质疑之声过于年轻，过于稚嫩，无法撼动衰老麻木的灵魂丝毫。	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
他只得孤军作战，运筹帷幄，淡定自若。后来，一个多小时戏份全由兰登教授包揽，我一次次地问，怎么可能会让美貌与演技兼并的Ewan只扮演个闷骚的传教士，只打个酱油？直到教皇内侍冲上飞机，兰登教授在镜头前露出“他将牺牲小我拯救世人”的表情……我突然犹豫，莫非最初的猜测是错误的吗？果然，最后的结局来个大逆转！哈哈哈哈！	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
最后，他展开了恶魔的翅膀，让黑暗笼罩大地。一切原本天衣无缝，我甚至那么希望他能够成功。	<br><br>
	
 	
	
上帝赐于忠直之士智慧和心灵，却没有赐于其抗争的力量。	<br><br>
	
他披着天使的外衣，操控着恶魔的手指，可惜无法逾越，扮演上帝。	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T21">《失落的符号》书评</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
香港“文汇报”刊登了《 达文西密码 作者新书 没有想象中好看》(张俊峰)	<br><br>
2003年，丹布朗写了《达文西密码》，畅销全球，从2004年开始，在香港很多人开始谈论这本小说，热度延烧了一年多。六年后的2009年，他的新书《The Lost Symbol》(失落的符号)在9月15日正式首发，香港的书店也摆出了英文版，读者是否会继续捧场，我们拭目以待。 	<br><br>
	
传说中的“神秘之手” 	<br><br>
	
笔者买到的是英国BANTAM出版社的英文版，封面为暮色中的美国华盛顿特区国会山，还有一枚做成共济会标志的钥匙。 	<br><br>
	
在《The Lost Symbol》中，《达文西密码》男主角Robert Langdon的历史解谜角斗场从欧洲转回了美国首都华盛顿。一般人认为，美国是新大陆，建国只有两百多年，欧洲人第一次踏上新大陆也只是在四百年前，所 以和历史悠久的欧洲相比，美国远远不是一个历史解谜游戏的最佳场景。 	<br><br>
	
但在本书中，丹布朗引用了共济会(Mason)这个在美国影响巨大的组织，从而在笔下呈现了一个充满人类历史未解之谜的神秘的华盛顿特区。 	<br><br>
	
Langdon接到一个电话，邀请他前往华盛顿特区做一次演讲，致电给他的人自称是他好友 Peter Solomon的秘书。Solomon对Langdon而言亦师亦友，是引导他进入符号学领域的启蒙者，作为共济会的领袖，是美国最富有和最有影响力的 人。Langdon欣然前往，却发现指定的演讲会场并没有活动，而且，在地上赫然有一只被切断的右手，拇指和食指张开，其它三指拳握，每个指尖都被描上刺 青图案，拇指上是王冠，食指上是星星。他也很快发现，这只断腕就是好朋友Peter Solomon的。断腕的首饰和刺青图案，意味传说中的“神秘之手”(Hand of Mysteries)，在古代的仪式中，象征向被选中的精英发出邀请，去接受被封印的失落的智慧。 	<br><br>
<a href= "link07.html">希拉里和奥巴马的导师</a><br><br>
<a href= "link08.html">阿林斯基（Saul D. Alinsky）</a><br><br>
<a href= "link09.html">National Security Council</a><br><br>
	
“被封印的智慧” 	<br><br>
	
原来，Peter Solomon被绑架，绑架者是一个混入了共济会最高阶的人Mal'akh，他知道共济会掌握人类从古埃及时代流传下来的秘密，这秘密可以让人完全释放 出智慧的潜能，从而拥有类似神一样的能力。现在科学已经证明，人类的智慧能力只被开发了非常小的一部分，例如人的大脑在思考时几乎只用到十分之一的部分； 又如，人的精神确实可以对物质产生实际影响，现在被广泛传引的一个例子是，在手边一杯水结冰的过程里，如果你想美好的事，水的结晶会呈现美丽和规则的形 状；如果想的是负面的恶念，结晶就会呈现出混乱和丑陋。诸如此类。《The Lost Symbol》中，作者通过Solomon兄妹的谈话，揭示说，当代人类科技看似发达，但很多理论――如物理学中的纠缠理论、两极理论、十维理论――在古代都被提出来过。所以，人类现在的所谓“发现”，只是一种“再发现”而已。即，在智慧方面，人类的祖先远远比我们想象的要发达得多。 	<br><br>
	
但，当古代智慧发展到很高级阶段时，有一部分人类中的精英发现，那种能力几乎可以让人发挥出神一般的潜能，那就像双刃剑，可以带来好的飞跃，也会带来毁灭，于是就把这种智慧“封印”了，要等到人类有足够能力去接受这种智慧时才会解开“封印”。数千年 来，偶尔出现的屈指可数的人凭借天生的领悟能力、或者有幸学习了被“封印”的智能，便能做出在普通人看来超凡入圣的事。 	<br><br>
	
而古代时知道这“被封印的智慧”秘密的人，本来有众多分支，但经过历史的风化，特别是遭受欧洲中世纪对知识的消灭与禁锢，现在只有在新大陆生根发芽的共济会继续传承衣钵。 	<br><br>
	
美国先贤的秘密 	<br><br>
	
听起来玄而又玄，但丹布朗举实例说，建立美国的华盛顿、富兰克林、全盘设计美国首都华盛顿建筑规划的法国人L'Enfant都是共济会成员。在首都选址、为重要建筑物奠基等方面都充满了共济会的特色，比如国会大厦奠基时，由华盛顿穿共济会服饰放下基石，时间选在1793年9月18日的11点15分到12点30之间，因为，星相学上的“龙头”刚好在黄道十二宫的处女宫。之后其它许多建筑的落成，也都是选择“龙头”在处女宫的时间。 	<br><br>
	
此外，丹布朗借Langdon之口说明，华盛顿特区的主要建筑，都是希腊万神庙的风格，这种风格的建筑，在欧洲基督教成为权威后，其意义已经消失了，只有在华盛顿还保留了完整的作用。例如国会大厦里的圆形大厅，也就是Langdon看到好朋友 Solomon手掌的地方，就是古希腊的灶神(Vesta)的神殿，过去在地下的确还有祭祀意义的火焰。而圆形大厅的天顶壁画，更是具体呈现了华盛顿、富 兰克林等美国先贤“由人到神”的升华历程。在这本书中，丹布朗令人吃惊地提醒读者，美国有一座华盛顿塑像，被塑造成宙斯的形象。 	<br><br>
	
作者通过种种背景，告诉读者，共济会的秘密，是从远古保留下来的，比被基督教改造过的欧洲“旧世界”更接近古代的人类智慧。而这种智慧，就埋藏在华盛顿特区的某个地方，而开启的钥匙，又和Solomon曾经交给Langdon保管的一件护身符有关…… 	<br><br>
	
绑架Solomon并斩下他手掌的人，威胁Langdon为他打开通往失落的智慧宝藏之门。时间只有12小时。 	<br><br>
	
阅读乐趣不如《达文西密码》 	<br><br>
	
这个故事看似和《达文西密码》相似，充满了悬念和历史的魅力，但读下来感觉不如《达文西密码》那么精彩。 	<br><br>
	
一，从故事结构来看，节奏太慢，整个故事讲了四分之一，Langdon才刚刚进入解谜的状态，令人耐性大受考验。《The Lost Symbol》里，出场人物(16位)比《达文西密码》(11位)多，而且不是串联出现，而是平行按三条线索发展(一条是Langdon为主，一条是 Solomon的妹妹Katherine为主，一条是大反派Mal'akh)，而且故事虽然发生在12小时内，作者却常常用人物的回忆来交代前面数年的背景。相对来说不够紧密。 	<br><br>
	
二，出场的人物，魅力比《达文西密码》的角色逊色。《达文西密码》中，Langdon和 Sophia一路被人追杀，一路逃一路解谜，其它人物逐渐穿插进故事中，精彩纷呈。而在《The Lost Symbol》里，主角Langdon比以前更喜欢掉书袋，而且反应迟缓，让人捏把冷汗。这个故事里更难找到《达文西密码》里Sophia那样可爱的女主角和Teabing那样有魅力的反派。 	<br><br>
	
总体说来，《The Lost Symbol》仍然算得上是今年一部历史悬疑类的精彩小说，但读者要是抱对《达文西密码》一样的期待，也许会有些失望。据说丹布朗前两部小说《数字城堡》和《天使与魔鬼》都只卖了一万多本，后来凭借《达文西密码》才重新被人追读─《The Lost Symbol》受到期待也不无这种因素，但在本书以后，他下一部作品是否还能成为热点，就值得怀疑了。	<br><br>

无聊女教皇翻译考	<br><br>
《天使与魔鬼》漏洞集锦2012-07-16 	<br><br>
 注：根据http://www.decentfilms.com/articles/fact-checking-brown，by Steven D. Greydanus译写	<br><br>
	
《天使与魔鬼》曾是我最喜欢的丹布朗小说，不过看过这篇文章以后，偶像幻象破灭，《数字城堡》荣登榜首，这篇fact-checking文搁置了有快两年，今天译写一下好了：	<br><br>
	
 	
更多资讯，请访问：<a href= "http://www.retter2012.com" title="点击进入"> retter2012.com </a>。<br><br>
	
 	
	
首当其冲的问题是：哥白尼是怎么死的？	<br><br>
	
别告诉我你“知道”，根据“哈佛大学符号学家”兰登教授所言：哥白尼是一位直言不讳的科学家，他揭露科学事实，被教会残忍地杀害了。” 书中兰登与梵蒂冈警长奥利维蒂的对话中是这么说的: “The Illuminati … were physicists, mathematicians, astronomers. In the 1500s they started meeting in secret because they were concerned about the Church’s inaccurate teachings, and they were dedicated to scientific truth. And the Vatican didn’t like that. So the Church began to … hunt them down and kill them.”	<br><br>
	
电影中的版本是他向奥利维蒂更加直白地解释：“The Illuminati were a secret society dedicated to scientific truth. The Catholic Church ordered a brutal massacre to silence them forever.” 根据兰登的说法，哥白尼，伽利略还有伯尼尼都是光照派的成员。	<br><br>
	
最具“杀伤力”的一例“史实”是兰登引据的一起 “La Purga” 事件。电影中教授先生甚至对瑞士卫兵长里希特冷嘲热讽： “Geez, you guys don’t even read your own history, do you? 1668年，教会绑架了四名光照派科学家并在他们的胸口烙上了十字架，用以迫使四人反省罪孽。之后教会处决了他们，将尸首扔在大街上，警示众人违背教会的下场。Purga事件使得光照派开始发展成极端暴力和黑暗的组织。	<br><br>
	
虽然只是小说，但是丹布朗一再重申史实，地点等的真实性，使得粉丝们在很多方面被极端误导，来看看都有啥吧：	<br><br>
	
1 艺术和建筑范畴	<br><br>
	
丹布朗在小说扉页强调，关于艺术，建筑事物的引用是 “entirely factual (as are their exact locations)”的，他又颇为“画龙点睛”地加了一句“The brotherhood of the Illuminati is also factual” ，而这恰恰是最大的错误。	<br><br>
	
比如说，丹布朗在书中写到，罗马的Santa Maria della Vittoria教堂在Piazza Barberini广场，而事实上教堂却在一里开外（本人注：没错，我特地在罗马考证过，Piazza Barberini广场上就一个蓝色霓虹灯下的Bernini酒店，一个喷泉，四周都是饭店）。再比如，人民广场上的Santa Maria del Popolo教堂他说是在东南角，其实却是在广场北边。书中描写兰登“仰望教堂的玫瑰窗”（本人注：即一种圆形的窗户，也成rosette，常见于浪漫主义和哥特式教堂，见下图：英国布里斯托大教堂玫瑰窗），但实际上那座教堂的窗户根本就没有玫瑰窗典型辐射状石窗框和窗格。	<br><br>
	
丹布朗说Santa Maria del Popolo教堂是一座主教教堂(cathedral)，书中写到兰登 “see a spire or cathedral tower jutting up over the obstacles.” 在一个教区只应该有一座主教教堂，罗马的主教即教皇，他的主教教堂其实是St. John Lateran（这是个Basilica）。	<br><br>
	
丹布朗说伯尼尼的四河喷泉雕塑代表着“旧世界”（未发现新大陆时）四条大河：尼罗河，恒河，多瑙河和普拉塔河，但其实位于阿根廷和乌拉圭边境上的普拉塔河显然是属于“新世界”的。其实四河喷泉其实是代表了文艺复兴制图法时期已知的四块大陆：非洲，亚洲，欧洲和美洲。	<br><br>
	
同样，丹布朗关于谁埋在哪儿的说法也都和事实大相径庭。比如他说拉斐尔的墓室1758年才从意大利Urbino移入万神殿的，而这地方根本就不存在，拉斐尔从一开始就一直葬在万神殿。他还写道教皇亚历山大七世，即“齐吉”，是葬在Santa Maria del Popolo教堂的齐吉礼拜堂，而其实人家是葬在梵蒂冈的圣彼得大教堂。 	<br><br>
	
兰登先生饶有兴致地说过：米开朗基罗设计了瑞士卫兵的制服以及梵蒂冈博物馆中的螺旋楼梯。而事实上，不仅他把博物馆的名字Musei Vaticani 写成了Musèo Vaticano ，而且米大师和制服以及楼梯都没什么干系。楼梯其实是近代产物：1932年由Giuseppe Momo设计。	<br><br>
	
上述错误不过是一些小差小错，更严重的错误出现在有关圣彼得广场路面瓷砖的描写上：“西风”（本人八卦：记得吗，杀人案发生地呀）。他说西风被拟人化塑造成一个经典的神像头颅，望向东方。书中这个情节非常重要，因为这个据说是伯尼尼留下的线索，指向了下一场凶杀案的地点。布朗说这个瓷砖叫做west是因为在伯尼尼的时代，17世纪，英语尚属于“罗马人尚不能驾驭”的”the one language the Vatican had not yet embraced” 。这里问题多了去了。首先，西风瓷砖主题是圣彼得广场16个辐射主题的一个，它们排成圆形，指向广场中心，形成罗盘状，所谓“玫瑰罗盘”/“风之玫瑰”是也（拉丁语：rosa dei venti，“风神之玫瑰”，反方向指向天地各方。所以西风对应的是东风，但在电影中的“惊鸿一瞥”显示：只有西风砖才指示方向（它那十五个兄弟呢？！）再者说，这些瓷砖设计根本就不是伯尼尼的杰作！根据圣彼得大教堂官网www.StPetersBasilica.org那都是三百年以后加上去的（教皇庇护九世时期）：1852年英语可真没什么见不得人的。 	<br><br>
	
再说教皇庇护九世时期，1857年的“大阉割”事件：说教皇拿了根棒槌，把梵蒂冈每个男性雕像的小弟弟都砸了，在书中，兰登教授甚至认为有一个秘穴藏匿着这些石头小弟弟“向这场艺术灾难发表无声的抗议”。但其实，小弟弟并没有被砸掉，只不过是后加上了石头无花果叶，而去掉叶子的话，对于雕塑的损坏更大，所以就成了今天的样子。	<br><br>
	
2 真作假时假亦真	<br><br>
	
丹布朗的错误并不只存在小说中，那样他还能辩解一下：“这是虚构小说！”个人官网中提及自己如何获得灵感写下《天使与魔鬼》的文章中他写道：	<br><br>
	
I was beneath Vatican City touring a tunnel called il passetto ― a concealed passageway used by the early Popes to escape in event of enemy attack. According to the scholar giving the tour, one of the Vatican’s most feared ancient enemies was a secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati ― the “enlightened ones” ― a cult of early scientists who had vowed revenge against the Vatican for crimes against scientists like Galileo and Copernicus. I was fascinated by images of this cloaked, anti-religious brotherhood lurking in the catacombs of Rome. Then, when the scholar added that many modern historians believe the Illuminati is still active today and is one of most powerful unseen forces in global politics, I knew I was hooked … I had to write an Illuminati thriller.	<br><br>
	
这个故事带有点回忆录性质，理应是纯事实构造，但是Passetto di Borgo并非什么“梵蒂冈城下的地道”，而是一条上升的过道，半隐半现，伪装成一道从梵蒂冈城到圣天使堡的墙垒。如果布朗真要是按照文中所写走过这条路就会发现自己的弥天大错。他称，自己要感谢某“学者”带他游览，而事实上，这位在致谢中出现的“Sylvia Cavazzini”无处可寻，起码在期刊文献中没有她的踪迹。我估计，布朗估计捏造了网搜的某个路人甲吧。整个“兰登教授系列”的前提本是通过其学者身份制造一种可信度，但是有关书中出现的种种可笑错误，让这成为极大的讽刺。	<br><br>
	
3 科学，光照派和教会	<br><br>
	
历史上的光照派并非建于16世纪，哥白尼，伽利略和伯尼尼也不是它的成员，哥白尼死了两百多年后，伯尼尼死了将近一百年后光照派才诞生。它是黑暗时代的秘密协会，建于1776年，同美国生日一天，它的成员多是政治上的自由派，和科学不太搭（本人注：不过富兰克林是个例外吧）。尽管光照派对宗教并非很友好，但是也绝对不存在什么“复仇的血誓”，什么为“哥白尼和伽利略报仇雪恨”这种。事实上，没有明显证据可以证明哥白尼遭到过教会迫害，而伽利略时间当然是教会历史上的一个黑点儿，但是终身监禁这种温吞漫长的惩罚很难引发什么“血盟复仇”的极端爆发。	<br><br>
	
作为一个牧师，叔父还是主教，哥白尼和教会权威没有什么冲突：他在卡布阿红衣大主教的请求下著述了六卷文献《论天国领域的革命》(On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres)，并且将这部作品献给了教皇保罗三世。在此之前，哥白尼还受教皇利奥十世之邀进驻拉特兰宫参议，致力于历法的重修。他使得教会对历法有了新的改制，尽管死后引起诸多争议，但这些争议大多归结于某文段或者某“不和谐”字眼。哥大人70岁的时候死于中风，什么“被教会谋杀”简直是诽谤！	<br><br>
	
这些将教会定位成恶人的小说如《圣血与圣杯》《天使与魔鬼》《达芬奇密码》等来源于美国长久以来对天主教的抵抗传统（本人注：现在不难看出本文作者Steven D. Greydanus的立场，请大家保持中立态度，就看看事实错误部分，不要受到任何无端的信仰干扰。个人觉得挑历史bugs是一件很欢乐的事情，娱乐即可）。其中反天主教的顶峰要算Charles Chiniquy1886年的《罗马教会五十载》 (Fifty Years in the Church of Rome )。这部论战性作品宣称Blaise Pascal还有哥白尼都被逐出教会，伽利略被鞭打然后关进地牢。这些并非真实，Pascal是有异端性倾向，但从来没有面临被逐出教会，而伽利略就是在家中被监禁，没被鞭打折磨或者被关进地牢过。而今天，教会大规模迫害处决科学家已经是一件广为被接受的“事实”（本人按：此处本人未考证，请自行考证，要么是大家都错了，要么是Steven D. Greydanus太胆大了，不过他既然敢这么写，也不能说是捕风捉影，ok，谨记娱乐目的）。	<br><br>
	
而所谓La Purga事件更是一个虚构出来的，卫兵长里希特说不定还是读了历史的！没有什么暗杀，什么烙印，什么四名科学家，也没有什么横尸街头，警示世人。唯一可考的被天主教会民间组织处决的是16世纪的多米尼克人Giordano Bruno。Bruno是一个日心说者，但他之所以被处决是因为他质疑上帝的三位一体性质。	<br><br>
	
丹布朗写道：欧核中心科学家一直抗议，要求梵蒂冈教会为哥白尼和伽利略事件道歉。估摸着就哥白尼问题，人家的回答是For what?而伽利略这个反天主教神话中唯一真实的案例，也由于添油加醋和不断强调变成了一个典型，而不是被视为优秀的科学家。作者说伽利略被判决是因为异端邪说，但是其实他是“vehemently suspect of heresy”并且” almost executed”。至于原因，布朗解释为是因为 “daring to imply that God had placed mankind somewhere other than at the center of His universe.”，这暗指了中世纪的以神为中心的观点其实是以人为中心。但实际上，中世纪普遍的观点是地球是宇宙中最低等最弱的星球，离明亮美好的天国最为遥远，而地狱则是在天国中心（本人注：此处我也混乱了）。	<br><br>
	
布朗还说，由于教会认为天体必须按照完美的圆形轨道运行，所以伽利略提出椭圆轨道时触怒教会，招致杀身之祸。但其实恰恰是伽利略自己把圆形轨道的观点捧为真理，反对任何形式的椭圆形轨道说法。这并非伽利略的唯一错误，更多请见The Galileo Controversy	<br><br>
	
尽管在丹布朗的书中，科学家们认为，信念和理性更加互补，而不是通过抗衡。但书中不断强调科学家的开化精神和教会的宣称之矛盾冲突是 “the sole vessel through which man could understand God” 。这么一来，他就彻底地抹杀了基督教在科学诞生初期的重要地位。在过去的五十年间，几乎所有的历史学家都公开表明，科学革命是受及基督教的恩惠（见Dr. T. Woods：How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization, p. 4）。 天主教宗教理论不仅提供了现代科学发展的框架（因为第一批现代科学家认为宇宙由一个理性的创世者创造其实就是由理性的规律创造），而且许多科学家就是牧师或者信徒，更不用说教会提供的直接资助和社会扶持（尤其是在天文学方面）。丹布朗却借书中第一反派卡洛之口说 “Since the days of Galileo our church has tried to slow the relentless march of science.”	<br><br>
	
4 科学？	<br><br>
	
有关高科技的部分，丹布朗尚维持在科幻小说的框架之内，可惜不太聪明，他东挪西补，试图使这一部分符合他的主题。所谓“反物质爆炸”本来纯属科幻，尽管在《星际迷航》中传送机和时空扭曲都是基于这一“可考”理论而成立的。但书中写到，反物质其实是存在的，通过和正物质碰撞，会释放大量能量，一丁点反物质可以产生几万吨炸药的力量。布朗在访谈中就“反物质是真的吗”这一问题回答：	<br><br>
	
Absolutely. Antimatter is the ultimate energy source. It releases energy with 100% efficiency (nuclear fission is 1.5% efficient.) Antimatter is 100,000 times more powerful than rocket fuel. A single gram contains the energy of a 20 kiloton atomic bomb―the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. In addition to being highly explosive, antimatter is extremely unstable and ignites when it comes in contact with anything … even air. It can only be stored by suspending it in an electromagnetic field inside a vacuum canister. If the field fails and the antimatter falls, the result is a “perfect” matter/antimatter conversion, which physicists aptly call “annihilation.” CERN is now regularly producing small quantities of antimatter in their research for future energy sources. Antimatter holds tremendous promise; it creates no pollution or radiation, and a single droplet could power New York City for a full day. With fossils fuels dwindling, the promise of harnessing antimatter could be an enormous leap for the future of this planet. Of course, mastering antimatter technology brings with it a chilling dilemma. Will this powerful new technology save the world, or will it be used to create the most deadly weapon ever made?	<br><br>
	
这简直是一派胡言，而且不仅在小说中出现（有虚构的意味），还在现实访谈中加以强调。反物质作为能源完全不可能，欧核中心研究反物质也绝非为了什么“未来的能源危机”，而是纯属出于研究基本物理原理的目的。	<br><br>
	
反物质也绝非比普通物质能量更大。两物质相撞的能量不过是两个粒子能量的结合。比如一个反质子比正质子的能量不会多。反物质同任何物质结束不会燃烧，而是消灭与它相对应的粒子。如果反物质是可以开采的，然后可以和普通物质抵消，那可能可以用来作为能源，就像我们燃烧树木获得在木头中储存的太阳能。但是如果没有太阳的话，木头就不能作为能源，否则就得用人工光能种树。可见，照耀树木的光能将远超过燃烧树木所获得的能源收获――这是个失去能量的过程，并非创造能量的过程。一言蔽之，这个原理也适用于反物质。唯一获得反物质的方法就是我们去创造反物质，以巨大的能源消耗为代价。同树木储存能量释放能量原理一样，使正反物质碰撞获取的能量远远低于创造反物质所需的能量。所以，就算一小滴反物质能够给整个纽约城供一个月的电，那就得花费纽约城十亿年供电量的能量来创造这一小滴反物质。就算科技发展到我们可以无能源损耗地创造反物质，那我们也不能得到比付出更多的能量。所以把反物质当成能源什么的是绝无可能性的。	<br><br>
	
而且大部分欧核中心制造的反物质都立刻和其对应物质碰撞了，虽说使用电磁极容器确实可以保存反物质没错。布朗所说的2002年的ATHENA和ATRAP实验确实成功地一次性制造出了无数反氢原子。但是想要制造出1克的反物质，以及保存这1克的反物质都还超出了现有科技的能力。这么说吧，1克的反氢含有6.022 x 1023 个原子（所谓阿伏伽德罗数字），而欧核中心要制造出这么多得需要几十亿年，造出来也找不到东西装。这个问题详见欧核中心针对《天使与魔鬼》所专门建立的辟谣（加娱乐）的 Angels & Demons FAQ. 网站对于布朗君作为作家所犯下的错误保持了高度的宽容。	<br><br>
	
在兰登横跨大西洋的旅途中，他说人如果在四万英尺高空飞行体重会轻百分之三十。但其实那个高度的影响对体重不超过百分之一。	<br><br>
	
拉丁语翻译错误：书中和电影中都成有望成为下届教皇的红衣大主教为preferiti，而实际上标准说法是papabile（即“popeable/pope material”）。布朗还把 “Novus Ordo Saeclorum”翻译成“New Secular Order” 并指向光照派（本人注：原因应该是他在文中把Saeclorum写成了Seclorum，所以翻译成了Secular，但是其实拉丁语原形是saeclorum，“世纪”一词的复数属格，所以应该是New Order of the Ages的意思，看看记住词根该有多么重要呀）。	<br><br>
	
丹布朗还写道天主教圣餐仪式是借用Aztec人的，而Aztec文明一千年后才出现（都别提基督教早期，文明怎么横跨大西洋传播这个大BUG了！）他还把印度的哈塔瑜伽归于佛教传统，也让佛教“早生”了不少年。 	<br><br>
	
丹布朗还混淆了多利安和艾奥尼亚问题，他说多利安秩序是艾奥尼亚的希腊对应物，而其实这两者都是原生希腊。	<br><br>
	
他说梵蒂冈的瑞士卫兵是是 “the sworn sentinels of Vatican City”，这个更加适用的对象其实是梵蒂冈自有宪兵(gendarmerie)，因为瑞士卫兵护卫的是教皇本人，而不是梵蒂冈城（电影中有所纠正）。书里面则写道瑞士卫兵在圣彼得广场便衣潜伏工作，而事实上他们会出现在圣彼得广场，要么是教皇在广场上，要么就是人家下班遛弯儿呢。	<br><br>
	
……	<br><br>
	
 原作者说：An exhaustive list would be nearly impossible. It is hard to find an unproblematic page of Angels & Demons. “想要仔细列出所有错误太难了，因为书里面没有一页是无缺的。”	<br><br>
	
5 这都啥跟啥即我的结尾按	<br><br>
	
本文作者在第五部分详细批判了丹布朗的写作风格和能力：“除了《暮光之城》以外是他看过最烂的小说”，那么你就可以明白，这家伙不是和丹布朗有私仇就是……额，我也不知道什么原因。反正我觉得丹布朗的书在娱乐性上相当强啊，《暮光之城》是真心烂。不过本文作者引用爱丁堡大学语言学教授Dr. Geoffrey K. Pullam的话（which是针对布朗作品较早的文评之一）: “staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad. In some passages scarcely a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared with alternatives.”例子还挺多的，什么文法不通，前后矛盾，句子构造诡谲等等，这一部分我就略过了，因为写作嘛，仁者见仁智者见智的事情，“你忧伤了流年”不也在中文中比比皆是？就不苛求我还挺喜欢的这位通俗小说作者了。不过Stieg Larsson的书就显得持重很多，哎，英年早逝，才不留人啊。	<br><br>
	
不过亚马逊上点击率最高的积极读者评论是这么写的：	<br><br>
	
I don’t mind suspending disbelief if a story is well written and ANGELS AND DEMONS fit nicely in that category. What makes Dan Browns’s books spectacular (in my humble opinion) is the attention to detail and the research that he incorporates into his stories. I was fascinated by Brown’s telling of the secrets of the Vatican and the Illuminati and the parts played by Galileo and Bernini.	<br><br>
	
额，根据我之前的译写，这个还真是很讽刺很讽刺啊！	<br><br>
	
我自认为小说给予人虚构的空间很大，有关历史人物的添油加醋也不是没有，但是就丹布朗从头至尾给读者蓄意营造的真实氛围来说，他需要为某些情节错误负责，比如最基本的建筑地理位置什么的。不过我要说，他给我在罗马的旅行带来很多寻宝似的快感，比如去天使堡，我会想，啊哈，这是关押四个红衣主教和维多利亚的地方啊！比如看到四河喷泉，我会想到啊哈，兰登在这里救了最后的教皇！比如大雪中我没有去成人民广场上的齐吉礼拜堂，因为它还在整修，我就想到书中就在整修，修了这么多年还在修，吐槽无力！其实还是挺娱乐的不是么？不过关于哥白尼的问题，我还真被忽悠了，不过我也没有考证到底本文说的是不是真的，在这个信息纷杂的世界如果在网上较真你还真就输了，我还是相信图书馆的书籍多一些。这篇译写文献给我心爱的罗马和我的拉丁语老师们。	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T23">Fact-checking Angels & Demons</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

By Steven D. Greydanus	<br><br>
	
Quick, how did Copernicus die? 	<br><br>
	
Dan Brown readers “know” the answer: “Outspoken scientists like Copernicus” were “murdered by the church for revealing scientific truths,” according to a tag-team history lesson by Harvard “symbolist” Robert Langdon and CERN director Maximilian Kohler in Angels & Demons, the predecessor to Brown’s blockbuster sequel, The Da Vinci Code. 	<br><br>
	
On May 15, the new Ron Howard adaptation of Angels & Demons ― reworked as a sequel rather than a prequel to Howard’s 2006 smash The Da Vinci Code ― will bring another installment of the Dan Brown version of history to millions of moviegoers. While the new film doesn’t repeat the specific charge of the murder of Copernicus, it maintains the larger historical context set forth in Brown’s Angels & Demons: the Church’s murderous persecution of science, especially in the Illuminati, a secret society that Brown claims counted Copernicus, Galileo and Bernini among its members. 	<br><br>
	
Here’s how Tom Hanks’s Langdon describes the relevant history in an exchange with Vatican police head Ernesto Olivetti: “The Illuminati … were physicists, mathematicians, astronomers. In the 1500s they started meeting in secret because they were concerned about the Church’s inaccurate teachings, and they were dedicated to scientific truth. And the Vatican didn’t like that. So the Church began to … hunt them down and kill them.” In another clip Langdon puts it even more succinctly: “The Illuminati were a secret society dedicated to scientific truth. The Catholic Church ordered a brutal massacre to silence them forever.” 	<br><br>
	
Specifically, Langdon cites a supposedly historical incident he calls “La Purga.” In the film version, Langdon upbraids Swiss Guard head Commander Richter for his historical ignorance: “Geez, you guys don’t even read your own history, do you? 1668, the church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists and branded each one of them on the chest with the symbol of the cross, to purge them of their sins. And they executed them, threw their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop questioning church ruling on scientific matters. They radicalized them. The Purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati, one bent on … on retribution.” 	<br><br>
	
The specifics ― Copernicus, the year in which La Purga took place ― create an aura of facticity taken seriously by many fans of Brown’s yarns. Although his defenders sometimes demur that Angels & Demons, as well as The Da Vinci Code, is “just fiction,” Brown has never wavered in insisting on the solid factual basis for his stories ― and many of his more credulous fans have no idea just how much he routinely gets wrong. 	<br><br>
	
In a Q&A billed as an “interview” on his own website, Brown writes (in a comment recently highlighted by Carl Olson in This Rock), “My goal is always to make the character’s [sic] and plot be so engaging that readers don’t realize how much they are learning along the way.” Or how much misinformation they’re absorbing. 	<br><br>

Art and architecture	<br><br>
	
In particular, Brown claims that his narrative use of works of art and architecture is “entirely factual”: “References to all works of art, tombs, tunnels, and architecture in Rome are entirely factual (as are their exact locations),” he writes in an author’s note in Angels & Demons, adding, somewhat ungrammatically, “The brotherhood of the Illuminati is also factual.” (Statements may be “factual” or not; an institution or entity may or may not be historical, or accurately depicted ― and Brown’s Illuminati manifestly isn’t ― but in any case it can’t be “factual.”)	<br><br>
	
For years, Catholics, non-Catholic Christians and non-Christians with a low threshold for rampant disinformation have labored to set the record straight on countless points muddied in the book and movie versions of Brown’s tales. Brown’s inaccuracies start with the very point on which he claims strictest reliability: works of art and architecture ― and their “exact locations.” 	<br><br>
	
For instance, Brown locates Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome at Piazza Barberini, a half mile from its real location. He puts Santa Maria del Popolo at the southeast corner of the piazza, though it’s actually on the north side, and describes Langdon looking up at its “rose window,” though the church’s circular window lacks the stone mullions and traceries of a rose window. 	<br><br>
	
Brown also identifies Santa Maria del Popolo as a “cathedral.” Later he has Langdon straining to “see a spire or cathedral tower jutting up over the obstacles.” Possibly Brown doesn’t know what a cathedral is. There is only one cathedral in any diocese, the church that is the seat (cathedra) of the local bishop. (The bishop of Rome is, of course, the pope. His cathedral church is the Basilica of St. John Lateran.)	<br><br>
	
Brown says that the rivers represented by Bernini’s Four Rivers fountain represent “the four major rivers of the Old World ― The Nile, Ganges, Danube, and Rio Plata,” though the Rio de la Plata, an estuary on the border of Argentina and Uruguay, belongs to the New World, the four rivers being chosen to represent the four continents of Renaissance cartography (Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas). 	<br><br>
	
Brown’s claim of accuracy regarding “tombs” is equally false. Angels & Demons claims that a plaque in the Pantheon indicates that Raphael’s body was only relocated to the Pantheon in 1758, and that he was originally buried in Urbino. No such plaque exists, for the excellent reason that Raphael was buried in the Pantheon from the start. Brown also places the body of Pope Alexander VII, Alexander Chigi, in the Chigi chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo. In fact, Alexander VII is buried in the tombs of St. Peter’s Basilica. 	<br><br>
	
Brown ascribes to Michelangelo the design of the Swiss Guard uniforms and the spiral staircase leading to the Vatican Museums, which he incorrectly calls the Musèo Vaticano rather than the Musei Vaticani. In fact it appears that Michelangelo was not involved in the design of the Swiss Guard uniforms, and certainly had nothing to do with the spiral staircase of the Vatican museums, which is of 20th-century origin, designed by Giuseppe Momo in 1932. Among the treasures housed within the Vatican museums, Brown lists St. Peter’s Basilica, a separate structure. 	<br><br>
	
These are fairly incidental (if often glaring) errors. More problematic is a key reference to a tile in the pavement of St. Peter’s Square, the “West/Ponente” tile. The tile depicts the west wind personified as a classical godlike head blowing from the west. 	<br><br>
	
Brown presents the “West/Ponente” tile as an all-important clue left by Gianlorenzo Bernini, who designed St. Peter’s Square, supposedly pointing the way to the next location in the book’s scavenger hunt. Brown also claims that the use of the English word “West” on the tile represented, in Bernini’s day, a disreputable Anglicism ― English in the 1600s being, in Brown’s mythology, “the one language the Vatican had not yet embraced” and “did not control” (whatever that means).	<br><br>
	
There are a number of problems here. First and most obviously, the “West/Ponente” tile is one of sixteen markers in St. Peter’s Square arrayed in a circle and aligned to the points of the compass, forming a “compass rose” or “wind rose” (rosa dei venti) ― i.e., pointing in every direction. 	<br><br>
	
For instance, directly opposite the “West/Ponente” marker is the “E[a]st/Levante” marker ― and, if I saw correctly, the new film actually includes a doctored shot of this marker, with the wind/breath lines airbrushed from the image, thereby suggesting that only the “West/Ponente” tile points in a specific direction.	<br><br>
	
For another thing, the current wind-rose markers aren’t Bernini’s work at all. According to www.StPetersBasilica.org, they were added three centuries later, under Pius IX (and whatever the status of English in Bernini’s day, there was certainly nothing disreputable about it in 1852). 	<br><br>
	
	
One art-related charge made in both the film and the book is the notion of Pius IX’s “Great Castration” of Vatican City’s male statues in 1857, which supposedly involved the pope taking a mallet to the male organs of every single statue in the Vatican. (In the book, Langdon wonders if the Vatican still has a heap of stone penises somewhere as relics of this systematic vandalism.)	<br><br>
	
Did it really happen? More pointedly, how many people exposed to the idea will ever find out? (The truth is that fig leaves were added, but the statues were not castrated; rather, subsequent efforts to remove the leaves proved more damaging than leaving them in place.) 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
Beyond fiction	<br><br>
	
Brown’s misrepresentation of matters of art and architecture are not confined to the fiction of his novels. Here is how Brown describes how he got the inspiration to write Angels & Demons in a Q&A billed as an “interview” on his website: 	<br><br>
	
I was beneath Vatican City touring a tunnel called il passetto ― a concealed passageway used by the early Popes to escape in event of enemy attack. According to the scholar giving the tour, one of the Vatican’s most feared ancient enemies was a secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati ― the “enlightened ones” ― a cult of early scientists who had vowed revenge against the Vatican for crimes against scientists like Galileo and Copernicus. I was fascinated by images of this cloaked, anti-religious brotherhood lurking in the catacombs of Rome. Then, when the scholar added that many modern historians believe the Illuminati is still active today and is one of most powerful unseen forces in global politics, I knew I was hooked … I had to write an Illuminati thriller.	<br><br>
	
This biographical anecdote story garbles the fact that the Passetto di Borgo is not a “tunnel” located “beneath Vatican City.” It is an elevated passageway, partly covered and partly open, disguised as a wall running from Vatican City to Castel Sant’Angelo. If Brown had made that mistake in the fictional narrative of the novel, it might be just another blunder, but he says that he toured the Passetto and was even inspired to write the book there. How could Brown make that mistake if he had really toured it as he says? 	<br><br>
	
The credibility of Brown’s anecdote is further eroded by his description of the comments from the (here unnamed) “scholar” giving the tour: a thoroughly unhistorical description of the Illuminati as a “cult of scientists,” one of the Catholic Church’s “most feared ancient enemies,” who had “vowed revenge against the Vatican for crimes against scientists like Galileo and Copernicus.” (Who is this “scholar”? In his acknowledgments Brown thanks “Sylvia Cavazzini” for his tour of the passetto. Whoever “Sylvia Cavazzini” may be, she hasn’t published or otherwise left any scholarly paper trail that I could find; as far as I can tell, Dan Brown’s acknowledgment is the only obvious evidence of her existence anywhere on the Internet. )	<br><br>
	
This, of course, just happens to touch upon the central premise of Angels & Demons, the meta-narrative around which the action of the novel is constructed: the picture of the Church and science at war with one another. Brown connects this supposedly historical theme to a supposedly biographical event in his own life, implying a credible, “scholarly” basis for it, reinforcing the claim of his author’s note regarding the “factual” nature of the Illuminati. 	<br><br>
	
In fact, the whole premise ― much like Brown’s moment of subterranean “inspiration” and possibly the tour, the “scholar” and the history lesson he describes ― is almost completely lacking in reality. 	<br><br>
	
Science, the Illuminati and the Church	<br><br>
	
The historical Illuminati was was not founded in the 1500s, and its membership did not include Copernicus, Galileo or Bernini, all of whom died long before the Illuminati existed (in Copernicus’s case, well over two centuries; in Bernini’s, nearly a century). 	<br><br>
	
The Illuminati was an Enlightenment-era secret society. It was founded in the late eighteenth century, in 1776, the same year as the founding of the United States. Its members were politically minded freethinkers with no particular interest in science. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
Although the Illuminati were not friendly toward religion, there were no “vows of revenge” against the Church for “crimes against scientists like Galileo and Copernicus.” On the contrary, one would be hard pressed to come up with any evidence of any ecclesiastical “crimes” committed against Copernicus, and while the Galileo affair is certainly a black mark on church history, his fate (lifelong house arrest) was not the sort of outrage that tends to inspire murderous vows of revenge centuries after the fact. 	<br><br>
	
Copernicus was never at odds with Church authority. A cleric and bishop’s nephew, Copernicus published his six-volume work On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres at the urging of the Cardinal Archbishop of Capua, Nikolaus von Schonberg, and dedicated the work to Pope Paul III. Years earlier, Copernicus was invited to advise the Lateran Council, invoked by Leo X, regarding reworking the calendar, and his work informed the Church’s eventual reformation of the calendar. Although his writings proved controversial for a time after his death, the controversy centered on a few passages and isolated words. 	<br><br>
	
Copernicus died at the age of 70, of a stroke. The claim that he was “murdered by the church for revealing scientific truths” is sheer fiction, even libel. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
If the larger picture of the Catholic Church’s opposition to science and systematic persecuting scientists like Copernicus ― the meta-narrative around which Angels & Demons is constructed ― is almost completely without reality, it is also not a mere “product of the author’s imagination.” Just as The Da Vinci Code’s reading of history is drawn from sources like Holy Blood, Holy Grail, Angels & Demons exploits a misconception with long roots in American anti-Catholicism: a kind of anti-Catholic master myth celebrated in books like Charles Chiniquy’s 1886 diatribe Fifty Years in the Church of Rome. 	<br><br>
	
Chiniquy’s nineteeth-century polemic claims that Blaise Pascal as well as Copernicus was excommunicated, while Galileo was publicly flogged and sent to a dungeon. None of this is true (Pascal may have had heretical leanings, but never faced excommunication, while Galileo suffered nothing worse than house arrest, and was never flogged, tortured or imprisoned in a dungeon). Nevertheless, even today the picture of the Church systematically persecuting and executing scientists is popularly perceived as having some basis in history. 	<br><br>
	
La Purga is a wholly fictional event (perhaps Richter has read his history after all). There was no murder and branding of four scientists, Illuminati or otherwise, nor did the Church toss bodies in the street as a warning. (The only remotely scientifically minded historical figure I am aware of who was executed by Catholic civil authorities is the sixteenth-century Dominican Giordano Bruno. Although Bruno rejected geocentrism, and proposed that the sun was merely one star like any other, his conviction by the Roman Inquisition appears to have been for sadly typical reasons ― heretical beliefs regarding the nature of God, the Trinity, Jesus Christ and other points of fundamental dogma, in keeping with his pantheist worldview ― rather than for his ideas about the universe.)	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
Brown depicts CERN scientists routinely petitioning the Vatican for “apologies for Copernicus and Galileo.” In the case of Copernicus, the only conceivable response would be “For what?” Even Galileo, almost the only shred of fact in the anti-Catholic master myth of the Church’s persecution of scientists, has been both distorted beyond recognition in popular imagination and misrepresented as archetypal rather than exceptional. 	<br><br>
	
Brown exploits and reinforces this misperception, claiming that Galileo was convicted of heresy (in fact the finding was not heresy, but “vehemently suspect of heresy”) and was “almost executed” (nothing of the sort was ever in question) for “daring to imply that God had placed mankind somewhere other than at the center of His universe.” This last implies that the medieval geocentric model was flatteringly anthropocentric; in reality, the medievals saw the earth as the lowest and least glorious location in the universe, the farthest from the heights of Heaven (with hell itself at the very center). 	<br><br>
	
Brown shamelessly transposes a philosophical blind spot affecting Galileo himself to his critics, representing ecclesiastical authorities as insisting that heavenly bodies must move in perfect circular orbits and therefore attacking Galileo for daring to propose elliptical orbits. Actually, it was Galileo himself ― not church authorities ― who esteemed the perfection of circular orbits, and rejected the notion of elliptically orbiting heavenly bodies. (This wasn’t Galileo’s only mistake, scientific or otherwise. For more, see The Galileo Controversy.)	<br><br>
	
Although Brown acknowledges that many scientists ― including Galileo ― were devout believers who saw faith and reason as complementary rather than opposed, he insists that the enlightened attitudes of Galileo and others conflicted with the Church’s claim to be “the sole vessel through which man could understand God” (emphasis in original). 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
In doing so, Brown blithely ignores the crucial role of Christianity in the origins of modern science as well as the Church’s patronage of the sciences in the time of Copernicus and Galileo. As Dr. Thomas Woods notes, “For the last fifty years, virtually all historians of science ― including A. C. Crombie, David Lindberg, Edward Grant, Stanley Jaki, Thomas Goldstein, and J. L. Heilbron ― have concluded that the Scientific Revolution was indebted to the Catholic Church” (How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization, p. 4). 	<br><br>
	
Not only did Catholic theology provide the theoretical framework for the development of modern science ― since the first modern scientists believed that a cosmos ordered by a rational Creator was a cosmos governed by laws comprehensible to the reason of men created in His image ― many of the early scientists were priests and religious. Beyond that, the Church itself provided direct monetary and social support to science, particularly astronomy. 	<br><br>
	
Yet Brown claims, in a speech in the mouth of the camerlengo Carlo Ventresca in both the book and the film, that “Since the days of Galileo our church has tried to slow the relentless march of science.” Even educated people today have little notion of the Church’s role in the origin and growth of modern science ― and they won’t learn about it from Brown. 	<br><br>
	
Bad science	<br><br>
	
Although Brown’s treatment of scientific matters falls fairly under the rubric of legitimate science fiction, at least in part, it’s not very smart sci-fi (I would like to have read Michael Crichton’s take on an antimatter bomb), and Brown routinely botches things he could have gotten right without harming his premise. 	<br><br>
	
The basic conceit of an “antimatter bomb” is fair enough sci-fi, even if it is about as scientifically feasible as Star Trek’s transporters and warp drive. 	<br><br>
	
The basic facts are these. Antimatter is real, and it is routinely created in miniscule quantities at laboratories like the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, as Brown describes in Angels & Demons. Anti-particles do annihilate on contact with corresponding particles of normal matter, releasing energy equivalent to the two particles annihilated. In principle, annihilating a very large amount of antimatter at once ― a gram, say, as posited in the book ― would have the devastating effect Brown describes. 	<br><br>
	
However, Angels & Demons gets a great deal wrong that falls outside the scope of what is required by the story or what can be projected of future science. For example, both the book and the film speak of antimatter as a possible “energy source.” In fact, Brown himself presents this possibility as fact, not just in Angels & Demons, but in a Q&A interview on his website. Here is his response to the question “Is antimatter for real?”	<br><br>
	
Absolutely. Antimatter is the ultimate energy source. It releases energy with 100% efficiency (nuclear fission is 1.5% efficient.) Antimatter is 100,000 times more powerful than rocket fuel. A single gram contains the energy of a 20 kiloton atomic bomb―the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. In addition to being highly explosive, antimatter is extremely unstable and ignites when it comes in contact with anything … even air. It can only be stored by suspending it in an electromagnetic field inside a vacuum canister. If the field fails and the antimatter falls, the result is a “perfect” matter/antimatter conversion, which physicists aptly call “annihilation.” CERN is now regularly producing small quantities of antimatter in their research for future energy sources. Antimatter holds tremendous promise; it creates no pollution or radiation, and a single droplet could power New York City for a full day. With fossils fuels dwindling, the promise of harnessing antimatter could be an enormous leap for the future of this planet. Of course, mastering antimatter technology brings with it a chilling dilemma. Will this powerful new technology save the world, or will it be used to create the most deadly weapon ever made?	<br><br>
	
This is very largely nonsense ― and again, nonsense presented as fact, not as fiction. 	<br><br>
	
The notion of antimatter as an “energy source” is an absolute impossibility. It is not true that CERN scientists study antimatter “in their research for future energy sources.” CERN research on antimatter is basically just studying the fundamental laws of physics. 	<br><br>
	
Antimatter is no more “powerful” than regular matter. The energy released by a matterCantimatter annihilation is simply the combined energy of the two particles. An anti-particle ― say, an anti-proton ― contains no more energy than its opposite particle, a proton. Antimatter does not “ignite” when it comes into contact with “anything”; rather, every type of anti-particle annihilates on contact with its own corresponding particle of normal matter. Thus, anti-protons annihilate on contact with protons, positrons annihilate on contact with electrons, and so forth.	<br><br>
	
If antimatter were a natural resource that could be “mined” and then annihilated with regular matter, it might be possible to use it as an energy source, just as we burn wood in order to harvest the solar energy stored in the wood. However, wood could not be an energy source if there were no sun and we had to grow trees under artificial light. The energy expended in order to light the trees would always far exceed the energy harvested by burning the wood. The process would lose energy, not create it. 	<br><br>
	
That’s the situation in a nutshell with antimatter. The only way to get antimatter is to create it ourselves, at an enormous expenditure of energy. Of necessity, far more energy is expended in creating antimatter than could ever be harvested in annihilating it, just as more energy always goes into growing a tree than could ever be harvested by burning it.	<br><br>
	
	
Thus, while it may be true that a droplet’s worth of antimatter could power New York City for a month, the energy needed to create that droplet of antimatter in the first place would power New York for going on a billion years. Even if, per impossibile, the technology improved so that we could create antimatter with 100% perfect efficiency, we would still never get out more than we put in. For this reason, there is absolutely no prospect of creating antimatter as an “energy source.”	<br><br>
	
It would also, not incidentally, take billions of years to create enough antimatter to power New York for a month ― or to blow up Vatican City. Most of the anti-particles created at CERN are immediately annihilated on contact with their normal-matter particles. It is true that small amounts of (electrically charged) antimatter can be captured in an electromagnetic trap. It is also true, as Brown claims in an opening FACT statement, that recent experiments at CERN, notably the 2002 ATHENA and ATRAP experiments, succeeded in creating millions of antihydrogen atoms at a time. 	<br><br>
	
However, the technology to generate a gram of antimatter is completely beyond us, as is the technology to capture it. A gram of, say, anti-hydrogen would contain approximately 6.022 x 1023 atoms (a figure commonly known as Avogadro’s number). That is so much larger than the mere millions of anti-hydrogen atoms CERN is currently capable of making that to create a gram of anti-hydrogen using this process would take billions of years. It is also far more than the amount of anti-hydrogen containable with present technology. For more, see CERN’s own highly informative and entertaining Angels & Demons FAQ (now defunct at the CERN website, but still available via Internet Archive Wayback Machine).	<br><br>
	
It isn’t only with respect to the esoterica of antimatter that Brown gets science facts wrong. On Langdon’s trans-Atlantic flight, he’s told that people weigh thirty percent less when traveling at sixty thousand feet. In fact, the gravitational effect of rising to that altitude involves a change in weight of less than one percent. 	<br><br>
	
Whatever the subject, Angels & Demons reliably botches it. The book and film versions both refer to cardinals who are considered likely successors to the Chair of Peter as preferiti (“favorites”), rather than the standard term papabile (“popeable” or pope material).	<br><br>
	
Brown mistranslates “Novus Ordo Seclorum” as “New Secular Order” (and ascribes it to the Illuminati) rather than “New Order for the Ages.” He floats the outrageous claim that the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist was “borrowed from the Aztecs,” though the Aztec civilization came over a millennium later (not to mention the physical implausibility of trans-Atlantic cross-fertilization in the earliest days of Christianity), and likewise misascribes to Buddhism the Hindu art of hatha yoga, which predates Buddhism. 	<br><br>
	
He garbles Ionic and Doric columns, calling the Doric order the “Greek counterpart” of the Ionic, when in fact both are Greek. He calls the Swiss Guard “the sworn sentinels of Vatican City,” a description that would better apply to the Vatican gendarmerie, as the Swiss Guard defend the person of the Holy Father, not the Vatican city state. (The movie gets this right; the book doesn’t. The book refers to a Swiss Guard working undercover in St. Peter’s Square. The only reason real Swiss Guards would be in St. Peter’s Square would be if the pope were there or if they were off duty.)	<br><br>
	
An exhaustive list would be nearly impossible. It is hard to find an unproblematic page of Angels & Demons. 	<br><br>
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
“Almost ingeniously bad”	<br><br>
	
Even for sheer popcorn entertainment value, while Angels & Demons offers a more engaging plotline than the turgid Da Vinci Code ― and makes for a more watchable film ― the sheer clunkiness of Brown’s literary mechanics make the book a chore to wade through. It would not be an overstatement to say that Brown’s writing is the worst prose style I have ever encountered in a popular edition, with the possible exception of Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series. (I have read worse writing in self-published and obscure works, as well as online.) 	<br><br>
	
“Brown’s writing is not just bad,” writes Dr. Geoffrey K. Pullam, Professor of General Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, in the first of a number of blog posts on Brown at Language Log. “[I]t is staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad. In some passages scarcely a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared with alternatives.” 	<br><br>
	
	
	
Among other things, Pullam calls out Brown’s penchant for opening action scenes with clumsy “curriculum vitae details” in sentences like “Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum’s Grand Gallery” (the first sentence of The Da Vinci Code) and “Physicist Leonardo Vetra smelled burning flesh, and he knew it was his own” (the first sentence of Angels & Demons). Pullam delights in debunking Brown’s literary non sequiturs: a voice “chillingly close” yet fifteen feet away; a “mountainous silhouette” with visible pupils and irises as well as skin and hair color. 	<br><br>
	
	
Pullam’s examples are from The Da Vinci Code; similar instances from Angels & Demons aren’t hard to find. On the first page of chapter one of Angels & Demons, we read that “Langdon sat up in his empty bed”; two pages later, “Robert Langdon wandered barefoot through his deserted Massachusetts Victorian home … ” But he’s still in the bed on the first page, and obviously occupying his Massachusetts Victorian home; you can’t sit up in an empty bed or wander through your deserted home, barefoot or otherwise. 	<br><br>
	
	
This, of course, is Brown’s inept way of letting us know that Langdon lives and sleeps alone ― which perhaps partly explains the author’s embarrassing eagerness, two paragraphs later, to establish his hero’s virility and attractiveness. “Although not overly handsome in a classical sense,” we read, “the forty-year-old Langdon had what his female colleagues referred to as an ACE ECERUDITEappeal ― wisp of gray in his thick brown hair, probing blue eyes, an arrestingly deep voice, and the strong, carefree smile of a collegiate athlete.” 	<br><br>
	
 	
The next paragraph goes on to tell us how Langdon’s friends “had always viewed him as a bit of an enigma” ― a bohemian classicist who could be seen “lounging on the quad in blue jeans, discussing computer graphics or religious history” as well as “in his Harris tweed and paisley vest, photographed in the pages of upscale art magazines at museum openings where he had been asked to lecture.” 	<br><br>
	
Literarily, the problem with this preoccupation with Langdon’s credentials as a fascinating, virile, maverick man of the world is that in this scene Langdon is ― as Brown has clearly if clumsily established ― alone in his home; there’s no one else in the scene for Langdon to impress with his erudite appeal, or through whose eyes we might experience the Langdon effect. So either Langdon himself is sitting around meditating on his own personal mystique ― or else, if no one in the scene is thinking about it, we have the author transparently telling (rather than showing) what he wants us to know about his hero, which is to say, indulging his own authorial enthusiasm for his hero’s mystique (with the implication that readers will be equally fascinated).	<br><br>
	
<a href= "link02.html">《野心时代》</a><br><br>
	
	
All of this would be embarrassing enough if Brown merely admired his hero ― but in fact it’s pretty obvious that Brown views Langdon as a fictional version of himself. Five minutes into my first experience of Brown’s writing, a few pages into The Da Vinci Code, having read about Langdon’s “scholarly allure,” his voice that female students described as “chocolate for the ears,” and his general “Harrison Ford in Harris tweed … and Burberry turtleneck” look, I suddenly knew that if I flipped to the back dust jacket flap, I would find a picture of the author wearing precisely that tweed and turtleneck look. (Sure enough, there it was.) 	<br><br>
	
Why is Brown so popular? What do fans see in Angels & Demons? Here, from Amazon.com, is the most highly rated positive user review of Angels & Demons ― not a user review chosen at random, but the positive review voted most helpful by other users: 	<br><br>
	
I don’t mind suspending disbelief if a story is well written and ANGELS AND DEMONS fit nicely in that category. What makes Dan Browns’s books spectacular (in my humble opinion) is the attention to detail and the research that he incorporates into his stories. I was fascinated by Brown’s telling of the secrets of the Vatican and the Illuminati and the parts played by Galileo and Bernini.	<br><br>
	
Well written, attention to detail, research incorporated into the stories. What more is there to say?	<br><br>

Mail: Re: Fact-Checking Angels & Demons: Lies, Damned Lies and Dan Brown	<br><br>
	
	
Although I don’t necessarily agree 100% with all of Dan Brown’s “theories,” there is something to be said about “reference material.” Sir, where did you get your facts from? If you have no source material to back it up, it leaves you in the same place as Mr. Brown.	<br><br>
	
The problem with the world is we all think we know everything, so instead of listening to what others are saying, and exploring the possibility of it being true, we stare quietly into the others eyes, the whole time not hearing a word due to the fact we are already thinking of the next “witty” thing to say. Being book-smart can make you very narrow minded. I can see by a lot of your comments that you are probably Catholic, and offended by his “facts.”	<br><br>
	
Which of my facts are you interested in?	<br><br>
	
On antimatter, I visited CERN in Geneva (courtesy of Sony Pictures) and spoke to actual quantum physicists (as well as Ron Howard and Tom Hanks), though most of the facts I referenced can be verified from CERN’s own website.	<br><br>
	
In Rome I visited the relevant churches (again courtesy of Sony), including Santa Maria del Popolo, Santa Maria della Vittoria, the Pantheon and St. Peter’s, where I saw the “West Ponente” tile (along with the 15 other tiles Brown conveniently ignores) and the tomb of Alexander VII (not, as reported by Brown, at Santa Maria del Popolo, which I can also verify is not where Brown said, or oriented in its piazza as he described). I saw the passetto wall where Brown claimed to be inspired to write Angels & Demons while touring “beneath Vatican City,” though in fact the passetto is above ground, not below.	<br><br>
	
I can vouch from my own eyes for the unreliability of Brown’s descriptions of churches, tombs and other architectural landmarks, despite his assurances that in this regard his book offers only “entirely factual” descriptions and “exact locations.” Again, most of this information can be verified by mass first-hand attestation from online sources.	<br><br>
	
Anyone can Google “Sylvia Cavazzini,” the “scholar” whom Brown claims gave him his passetto tour, and try to find online evidence of any academic work she may have done. Anyone can Google Bernini’s Four Rivers and see which rivers are represented (and consult an atlas to determine whether they are all in the Old World as Brown says). Anyone can look up the meaning of the word “cathedral” in a dictionary, or Google Musei Vaticani vs. Musèo Vaticano, something neither Brown nor his editors or proofreaders bothered to do.	<br><br>
	
I suspect you may be more interested in historical questions around the Illuminati, Galileo, La Purga and such. A question: If Brown is manifestly and consistently unreliable on matters of verifiable fact for which he promises an “entirely factual” descriptions and “exact locations” ― when he cannot even reliably report autobiographical details from his own life ― why should he be given any credence on matters of history where he appears to be at odds with historians of all stripes?	<br><br>

	2014 年 11 月 30 日 <br><br>

陀思妥耶夫斯基最著名的作品还有《罪与罚》、《白痴》、《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》等。	<br><br>
	
The New York Times 纽约时报 http://www.tuwang.org/ 	<br><br>
	
俄国19世纪小说家陀思妥耶夫斯基（Fyodor Dostoyevsky）笔下的人物中不乏那些用自己的理念和信仰为杀戮作辩解的人。	<br><br>
	
政治哲学家格雷（John Gray）认为，正是这一点，使得这位作家去世百余年而其作品始终不过时，无论是在极权主义国家兴起的20世纪，还是更靠近现在的“反恐战争”。	<br><br>
	
陀思妥耶夫斯基写思想理念以何等强大的力量改变人类生活，不是凭空想象；他有着切身体验。	<br><br>
	
陀思妥耶夫斯基（1821-1881）20来岁时在圣彼得堡加入了一个沉醉于法国乌托邦社会主义理论的激进文人圈子。被警方密探告发后，陀思妥耶夫斯基和同伴们被逮捕，数月后以传播颠覆性思想罪名被判枪决死刑，后减刑为流放到西伯利亚作苦力。	<br><br>
不过，沙皇决定臣民生死的权威必须得到体现，因此这些被减刑的死囚流放前要经历一次假枪决。一切都像演戏一样，经过精心策划和安排，但囚犯本人不知情。	<br><br>
	
1849年12月22日，陀思妥耶夫斯基和其他人被押到一个兵营的操练场，那里已经布置成临时刑场，宣读囚犯的罪状和判决书后，东正教神父让每个人忏悔一番。然后准备行刑。就在千钧一发之际，响起一阵鼓声，行刑队枪口向下，囚犯们被戴上镣铐发配到西伯利亚去了。	<br><br>
	
陀思妥耶夫斯基受到的惩处是当4年苦力，然后充军。1859年，新的沙皇昭令陀思妥耶夫斯基结束流放；一年后，他回到圣彼得堡文坛。	<br><br>
	
这是他人生和思想上的一个重大转折点。许多年后，他说，记忆中再没有任何时候比那一天更幸福了。他仍坚信俄国社会需要剧烈变革，封建农奴制极不道德，而且到生命的最后一刻他仍然唾弃有土地庄园的贵族。	<br><br>
	
但是，假枪决经历使他得以从新的角度看待时间和历史。自从那个他记忆所及“最幸福的一天”起，他意识到人生不是一个从落后的过去奔向更好的未来那样一种运动过程；这是他曾经与激进知识分子小圈子里的同伴们共同拥有的信念，现在破灭了。之后，他对曾经吸引他的那些渐进意识形态的不信任日益加深。	<br><br>
	
俄国虚无主义者在圣彼得堡被处死。	<br><br>
	
The New York Times 纽约时报 http://www.tuwang.org/ 	<br><br>
	
他从西伯利亚回到圣彼得堡后，对当时城里新一代俄国知识分子里流行的思潮十分不屑。欧洲各派理论和哲学观点，包括法国的物质主义、德国的人文主义和英国的功利主义，在俄国交融汇合成俄罗斯特色鲜明的混合物，后来被称作“虚无主义”。	<br><br>
	
1860年代俄国特色的虚无主义不是指寻常理解的“什么都不信”；俄国19世纪后半叶虚无主义者笃信科学，志在摧毁过去引导人类活动的宗教和道德传统，让旧世界让位于更新、更好的世界。值得一提的是，今天世界上不少人也有类似的观念。	<br><br>
	
魔鬼附体	<br><br>
	
小说《群魔》（Demon）可以看作陀思妥耶夫斯基对当时俄国虚无主义的批判。1872年出版的这部小说曾引起很大争议。毫无疑问，他要表达的一个观点是他那个时代的流行观点是有害的。	<br><br>
	
同时，小说讲述的故事又是个黑色喜剧，故事里那些好高骛远、对现实中的革命什么样一无所知却热烈地空谈革命的知识分子显得荒诞、滑稽。	<br><br>
	
小说的情节基本上按照写作过程中正在发生的一系列事件推进。谢尔盖・涅恰耶夫（Sergei Nechaev）从神学教师变成一名恐怖主义分子，一名学生被谋杀，他被捕并被控同谋。涅恰耶夫制作了一份小册子，宣扬为了革命事业可以使用一切手段，包括勒索和暗杀。遇害的学生在生前曾质疑他的政策，所以必须被消灭。	<br><br>
	
陀思妥耶夫斯基提出，为一种自由理念而抛弃道德，将变成一种前无古人的、更极端的暴政。《群魔》中的一个人物承认，他陷入了自己的数据迷宫，得出的结论与最初的观点截然相反；出发点是无限的自由，结论却是无限的专制独裁。	<br><br>
	
如果看作是对近50年后俄国布尔什维克革命的结果的描述，《群魔》的描写几乎很难超越。虽然列宁对涅恰耶夫过于依赖个人的恐怖行动有所批评，但却敬佩后者随时可以为了革命而做出任何犯罪行动。然而，正如陀思妥耶夫斯基预见的那样，通过不人道的方式得到一种新的自由，结果产生了一种比沙皇主义的残忍更宽泛、深远的压迫。	<br><br>
	
人类通病	<br><br>
	
陀思妥耶夫斯基的小说蕴涵的意义远远超越了俄国疆界。《群魔》的早期英译本书名译成 The Possessed （恶魔附体），那是对俄语词的误读，翻成“群魔”更贴近原意。但“恶魔附体”或许更接近作者的意图。尽管书中有些章节对这些革命者的描述毫不留情，但这些人本身不是恶魔；奴役了革命者的思想观念才是恶魔。	<br><br>
	
陀思妥耶夫斯基认为，俄国虚无主义的致命弱点是无神论。但是，即便不同意他这个观点，也不必赞同他的政治观，都可以看到，他对思想观念具有的魔法般力量的描述紧扣了一种真正的人类通病。	<br><br>
	
他诊断这种病的症状是，人类倾向于认为思想观念比现实存在的人更真实。他自己有时也有这种症状。如果想象我们自己并没有陷入这种臆想式的思维，那就错了。近十多年来，西方在中东打仗往往被抨击为纯粹为攫取自然资源而发动战争，但我相信这并非全部。要解释西方的不断干预和反复失败，还有一个同样重要的因素是一种道德幻想。	<br><br>
我们想象，诸如“民主”、“人权”和“自由”之类的理念有它们自己的威力，任何人接触到它们，生活就会被改变。我们发动了政权更替攻势，旨在通过推翻暴政来实现这些理念。但以这种方式输出革命会造成国家破裂的后果，就像在利比亚、叙利亚和伊拉克发生的那样，导致内战、无政府状态和新型的暴政。	<br><br>
	
其结果就是我们目前看到的自己所处的境地。现在驱动西方政策的是恐惧，恐惧的对象是以前西方干预造成的混乱中产生的力量和思想。令人悲哀的是，这种恐惧并非毫无根据。随着那些曾经到那些地方作战的西方人回国，那些冲突向我们反扑的危险真实存在。	<br><br>
	
我们愿意认为自由社会对思想的危险魔力有免疫力。但是，认为我们没有自己的魔鬼，那只是幻觉。在自由这个宏伟概念的魔咒下，我们试图改变其他国家的体制，而我们对那些国家甚至还没开始理解。就像陀思妥耶夫斯基小说里那些满脑子幻觉的革命者，我们也把抽象概念变成了偶像，然后为侍候这些偶像牺牲他人、牺牲自己。	<br><br>

ISIS让阿拉伯世界痛苦反思	<br><br>
	
2014 年 11 月 18 日	<br><br>
阿拉伯联合酋长国迪拜――19个人以伊斯兰教的名义牵头实施了“9・11”自杀式袭击，其中大部分是沙特青年。此事在逊尼派阿拉伯世界引发了争论，对于宗教以及他们的社会怎样催生了这种自杀性狂徒，人们各自发表了意见。但是，拒不承认的态度以及美国失败的伊拉克出兵行动很快就扼杀了那场争论。不过，目前在阿拉伯/穆斯林世界的一大中心迪拜，人们对话的内容显示，伊斯兰国（Islamic State，又称ISIS）“哈里发”政权在伊拉克和叙利亚的崛起，以及它野蛮对待反对者――温和的逊尼派和什叶派、基督徒、其他少数族群，以及妇女――的行径，重新点燃了关于“我们是谁”的重大辩论。	<br><br>
	
为什么会这样呢？因为伊斯兰国是土生土长的现象；它的目的不是打击远方的敌人，而是即刻就地传播并践行对伊斯兰社会的一种愿景；它吸引了包括西方在内的各地穆斯林青年；其意识形态是清教徒式的、一元的、伊斯兰教瓦哈比派的残暴变种，而瓦哈比是沙特阿拉伯的主导教派。这些意识形态通过Twitter和Facebook直接灌输给孩子，这事父母是知道的。这就是为什么它强迫这里的人们在镜中审视自身，无法回避，令人痛苦。	<br><br>
	
“我们无法再避免这场斗争了――我们坐在一辆驶向悬崖的火车上，”在位于迪拜的梅思巴研究中心(Al-Mesbar Studies & Research Center)担任顾问的阿卜杜拉・哈米达丁(Abdullah Hamidaddin)说。该中心对伊斯兰主义运动进行追踪，并致力于推动文化的多元化。不过，梅思巴有一个观点非常令人瞩目。他认为，ISIS不只是一个宗教问题，必须用一个更包容的伊斯兰叙事来予以打击；实际上，ISIS是这个地区所有问题的集中爆发：不够发达、宗派主义、教育滞后、性压抑，对女性缺乏尊重，以及所有智识思维都缺乏多元特质。	<br><br>
	
拉夏・阿奎迪(Rasha al-Aqeedi)是梅思巴的一名伊拉克编辑，来自摩苏尔。ISIS占领摩苏尔之后，她依然与当地人保持联系。阿奎迪告诉我，“那里正在发生的状况是”，摩苏尔的逊尼派穆斯林民众“如今已经从震惊中醒过来。之前人们会说，‘伊斯兰教十全十美，是[外面的世界]在针对我们，憎恨我们。’现在，人们开始阅读ISIS的理论。我听到摩苏尔有人说，‘我在考虑成为一个无神论者。’”	<br><br>
	
她还说：当一个六年级考试不及格的少年，在加入ISIS之后“告诉一名大学老师必须教哪些内容，以及他必须身着长衫时，你可以想象到那有多么让人震惊。我听到有人说：‘只要他们在这里，我就不会去清真寺祷告。他们并不代表伊斯兰教。他们所代表的是过时的、顽固不化的伊斯兰教。’”	<br><br>
	
除了ISIS内部的宗教狂热分子之外，你还可以看到，很多喜好投机的贫穷青少年被ISIS吸引，仅仅是为了能够高人一等。很多逊尼派教徒从摩苏尔附近的泰勒阿费尔赶来参加ISIS。该城比摩苏尔贫困得多，民众一直遭到摩苏尔逊尼派教徒的轻视。	<br><br>
	
“你会发现，这些（来自泰勒阿费尔的）男孩吸烟、喝酒，还纹身，”阿奎迪说。其中有一个加入了ISIS的男孩曾经找到一个我认识的人，让她穿上罩袍，把全身都遮起来――她平常已经在戴头巾，但没有蒙面纱。他对她说，‘如果你不穿罩袍，我会让一个你这种人从来都瞧不起的农村妇女来揍你一顿，’”真正的问题是谁说了算――极端伊斯兰主义只是借口。	<br><br>
	
“有些人会被温和宗派吸引，是因为他们本来就是温和的人，”哈米达丁说。“有些人被极端的绝对化的宗教思想吸引，是因为他们所处的扭曲的社会经济环境催生了对绝对化的解决方案的好感。”（这也是巴基斯坦穆斯林往往比印度穆斯林更加激进的原因之一。）	<br><br>
	
是的，宗教改革会有所助益，哈米达丁接着说。然而，“正是[伊拉克和叙利亚的]经济、安全和政治形势的全面恶化，才要求必须对世界进行明确的非黑即白的解读。要应对这一状况，需要正确的[政府]政策。”	<br><br>
	
马克苏德・克鲁泽(Maqsoud Kruse)是反暴力极端主义的希达亚国际中心(Hedayah International Center)的负责人，该组织总部设在阿联酋。他认为，击退“ISIS主义”将需要长期的投资，教育阿拉伯世界的公民，让他们拥有在现代社会中竞争和良好发展的能力。只有当地民众才能做到这一点，因为这是政府治理、学校教育和父母教育的共同挑战。	<br><br>
	
“实施自杀式爆炸的袭击者可以决定不去按动按钮，而我们的任务是知道怎样帮助他们做出这个决定，让他或她意识到，变得清醒和理性，而不是被蛊惑，”克鲁泽说。“重要的是我们如何教育和支持我们的年轻人，防止他们成为那种认为‘我掌握了真理’的人。”我们需要他们“有能力解构一些想法”，对极端主义有“免疫和适应能力”。关键在于，“我们怎么让他们停下来思考”――而不是鲁莽地采取行动。	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T25">光明会（Illuminati）</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
Martin Luther<br><br>
Every Man His Own Priest<br><br>
Priesthood of all believers<br><br>

光明会（英语：Illuminati），又被翻译为光照派或光明帮，是启蒙运动时期的一个巴伐利亚秘密组织，成立于1776年5月1日。[1] “光明会”通常被描绘成其成员试图阴谋幕后控制全世界。“光明会”有时也被作为“新世界秩序”的同义语。	<br><br>
光明会（Illuminati）的组织源头最早可追溯到中世纪的一些诺斯替教派（包括发源自巴比伦的摩尼教Manichaeism的影响），如：14世纪产生于拜占庭帝国的“赫西卡派”（Hêsukhia）；15世纪起源于西班牙加尔默罗会和方济各会修士中的“阿隆白郎陶斯派”（Alumbrodos），这些教派受到异端裁判所的追查，很多人被烧死.	<br><br>
在16世纪的欧洲宗教改革中，许多当时的数学家、物理学家、天文学家于艺术家等都是光明会的成员（如天文学家伽利略・伽利莱、尼古拉・哥白尼、焦尔达诺・布鲁诺、艺术大师济安・劳伦佐・贝尼尼等）。随着光明会的实力日渐壮大，罗马教廷感受到了极大的威胁，他们不会容忍这样一个旨在宣扬科学、反对教会的组织继续存在。因此，罗马教廷开展了一场“肃清运动”，用残忍的杀戮和威慑手段迫使光明会从此销声匿迹.	<br><br>
巴伐利亚王国因戈尔施塔特大学（University of Ingolstadt）的实践哲学教授亚当维索兹（Adam Weishaupt）宣传启蒙主义的人类伦理的完成可能说（Perfektibilismus），于1776年5月1日创建“完全可能性主义者之会”，同年改称巴伐利亚光明会。	<br><br>
对共济会的影响 	<br><br>
1780年，荷兰贵族、共济会员阿道夫・科尼格Adolph Freiherr Knigge的加入给社团带来新变化。他开始将光明会体系引入共济会，扩大在共济会中的影响。此时德国共济会的圣殿骑士体系已经式微，在1782年召开的威斯巴登共济会大会上（期间决定将总部迁至德国的Frankfurt）最终被废除，而科尼格和一些光明兄弟会领袖则取代玫瑰十字团在新的共济会体系中获得了领导地位。	<br><br>
光明兄弟会此时仿照共济会组织结构进行改组，核心领导机构称作阿瑞斯圣山Areopag，由怀斯豪普特和科尼格等社团领袖组成。此后，越来越多的共济会员开始加入光明兄弟会，包括很多贵族，如黑森亲王Karl von Hessen-Kassel，普鲁士将军Ferdinand von Braunschweig-Luneburg，萨克森-魏玛伯爵Karl August von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach。	<br><br>
而科尼格看到自己的努力并没有得到什么回报，他开始抱怨，并威胁将兄弟会秘密宣扬出去。这加重了怀斯豪普特的忧虑，因为像魏玛伯爵和歌德的加入似乎有探查的目的。 当时光明兄弟会的成员总共有二千人左右，其中1/3是共济会员，主要分布在巴伐利亚和图灵根的魏玛等地。会员成份有贵族、手工业者和商人，其中3/4是政府官员，达到了巴伐利亚政府官员总数的1/10，这与社团消灭集权政府的渗透计划有关。	<br><br>
危机与毁灭 	<br><br>
1784年光明兄弟会在魏玛召开会议，决定组建新的阿瑞斯圣山，将科尼格驱逐出会。	<br><br>
然而同一年，光明兄弟会面临了更大的危机。7月22日，巴伐利亚侯爵Karl Theodor颁布社团禁令，禁止一切秘密社团。1785年3月2日的新版法令中则指名光明兄弟会和共济会有叛国和异教罪行，令行禁止。斯代尔贝格伯爵Graf Stolberg-Rossla就因此被吊销了贵族头衔。	<br><br>
1787年8月16日又颁发了更为严厉的法令，任何加入共济会和光明兄弟会者都将被处以死刑。 禁令似乎起到了作用，此后光明会便消失了，怀斯豪普特则逃到图灵根州Thuringen躲藏起来。 禁令也在德国引起了恐慌，人们开始对秘密社团非常敏感，特别是法国大革命的爆发使各地政府风声鹤唳。 罗马教廷于1817年同普鲁士、1821年同巴伐利亚先后签订协议，共同加以镇压。	<br><br>
这样，短命的光明兄弟会反而成为欧洲秘密社团中最著名的，成为阴谋团体的代表。	<br><br>
与共济会的关系 	<br><br>
从目前材料看，光明兄弟会与共济会是相互独立的组织，虽然成员有交叉，一些思想和价值取向一致，但两者并非属于同一体系。共济会更类似一种宗教组织，偏重于教义和秘仪。而光明会则是政治组织，有独立的政治理想和行动纲领。光明会在后期对德国共济会产生了很大影响，但两者并未合并。	<br><br>
光明兄弟会成为西方秘密会社中最为著名也是最为卓著的。如美国70年代的惊悚小说《光明会三部曲》The Illuminatus! Trilogy认为怀斯豪普特在光明会被解散后来到美国，秘密谋杀了华盛顿并取而代之。这部小说影响了许多人，最近的如美国著名惊悚小说家丹・布朗Dan Brown的《天使与魔鬼》Angels and Demons，德文版即为《光明会》Illuminati，描述了光明会与梵蒂冈教廷的殊死斗争。	<br><br>
光明会被认为是共济会幕后的主导，是33度共济会大师的精英圈子。有些理论甚至提示光明会是在为一些想要征服人类的邪恶外星人所工作的，比如“爬虫族”、“小灰人”等等。这些理论都认为共济会与光明会操纵着当今欧美等国的金融、政治军事与娱乐界等领域，并且有一个人口削减计划，消灭有色人种，然后建立一个世界统一政府，以达到完全统治世界的目的（新世界秩序，New World Order）。	<br><br>

现代共济会（英语：Freemasonry）出现于18世纪西欧，自从1717年成立英格兰第一个总会所，至今其已经遍布全球。共济会是一种类似宗教的兄弟会，基本宗旨为倡导博爱、自由、慈善，追求提升个人精神内在美德以促进人类社会完善。会员包括众多著名人士和政治家，申请者必须是有神论者，相信存在着一位神[来源请求]。而其反对者则认为共济会主要是富人和权贵的阴谋组织，其有着不为人知的统治世界的秘密计划，比如世界新秩序等。<br><br>

共济会亦称石匠工会、美生会、规矩会，英文的字面含义是自由石匠工会。中文“共济会”一词取其组织性质。其会员被称为“美生”（英语：Mason，原意为石匠），这也是中文美生会一词的来源。会员之间以兄弟互称。<br><br>

共济会苏格兰礼仪式共分为33个级别，用度的符号“.”表现，但只有1.到3.涉及到等级概念：<br><br>

1.会员被称为“学徒”（英语：Entered Apprentice），非正式会员<br><br>
2.会员被称为“技工”（英语：Fellow Craft），非正式会员<br><br>
3.会员被称为“导师”（英语：Master Mason），正式会员<br><br>

1.-3.的席位授予在一般会所举行，从3.到33.各级别间都是平级的，但需要到总会所申请才能授予。[8]不同的级别在共济会意味着不同的研究学习内容，也代表了会员在不同时期的发展；[9]比如33.是共济会内部研究宗教的级别，但并非代表其为首领，是为荣誉头衔。在其他的礼仪里面，也依照同样的方式，大师级别及以上各级之间都是平等的关系。<br><br>

今天的共济会大约有600万人，苏格兰及爱尔兰会籍上约有15万名会员，英格兰会籍上约有25万名会员[10]，法国约7万人，美国境内也有约200万名会员 <br><br>

The Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, "enlightened") is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. Historically, the name refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on May 1, 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. "The order of the day," they wrote in their general statutes, "is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them."[1] The Illuminati―along with Freemasonry and other secret societies―were outlawed through Edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles Theodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790.[2] In the several years following, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.	<br><br>
In subsequent use, "Illuminati" refers to various organisations which claim or are purported to have links to the original Bavarian Illuminati or similar secret societies, though these links are unsubstantiated. They are often alleged to conspire to control world affairs, by masterminding events and planting agents in government and corporations, in order to gain political power and influence and to establish a New World Order. Central to some of the most widely known and elaborate conspiracy theories, the Illuminati have been depicted as lurking in the shadows and pulling the strings and levers of power in dozens of novels, movies, television shows, comics, video games and music videos.	<br><br>
Adam Weishaupt (1748-1830) was a professor of Canon Law and Practical philosophy at the University of Ingolstadt. He was the only non-clerical professor at an institution run by Jesuits, whose order had been dissolved in 1773. The Jesuits of Ingolstadt, however, still retained the purse strings and some power at the University, which they continued to regard as their own. Constant attempts were made to frustrate and discredit non-clerical staff, especially when course material contained anything they regarded as liberal or Protestant. Weishaupt became deeply anti-clerical, resolving to spread the ideals of the Enlightenment (Aufklarung) through some sort of secret society of like-minded individuals.[3]	<br><br>
Finding Freemasonry to be expensive, and not open to his ideas, he founded his own society which was to have a gradal system based on Freemasonry, but his own agenda.[3] On 1 May 1776 Weishaupt and four students formed the Bund der Perfektibilisten, or Covenant of Perfectibility, taking the Owl of Minerva as their symbol.[4] The members were to use aliases within the society. Weishaupt became Spartacus. Law students Massenhausen, Bauhof, Merz and Sutor became respectively Ajax, Agathon, Tiberius and Erasmus Roterodamus. Weishaupt later expelled Sutor for indolence.[5][6]	<br><br>
Illuminati members took a vow of secrecy and pledged obedience to their superiors. Members were divided into three main classes, each with several degrees, and many Illuminati chapters drew membership from existing Masonic lodges. The goals of the Illuminati were to eliminate superstition, prejudice and the domination of government, philosophy and science by the Roman Catholic Church, to reduce oppressive state abuses of power.[7] Weishaupt's original plan was for the Order to be named the "Perfectibilists".[3] The group has also been called the Bavarian Illuminati and its ideology "Illuminism".	<br><br>
Many influential intellectuals and progressive politicians counted themselves as members, including Ferdinand of Brunswick and the diplomat Xavier von Zwack, who was the Order's second-in-command.[8] The Order had branches in most European countries and reportedly had around 2,000 members over a span of ten years.[7] It attracted literary men such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johann Gottfried Herder and the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar.	<br><br>
Fundamental changes occurred in the wake of the acceptance of Adolph Freiherr Knigge into the order. Knigge was a young author and Freemason who was steeped in the Western mystery traditions from an early age. On his admission to the order, in 1780, he was charged with recruiting in five areas in the German states, and was soon in charge of hundreds of pupils. Asking for admission to the higher degrees of the order, to teach them to his recruits, he discovered that these degrees only existed in Weishaupt's mind. He was obliged (with Weishaupt's full authority) to write them himself. When Weishaupt attempted to retroactively edit Knigge's work, the two men fell out. Knigge left the order in 1783, depriving Weishaupt of his best theoretician, recruiter, and apologist.[9]	<br><br>
In 1777, Karl Theodor became ruler of Bavaria. He was a proponent of Enlightened Despotism and his government banned all secret societies including the Illuminati. Internal rupture and panic over succession preceded the society's downfall.[7] A government edict dated March 2, 1785 "seems to have been deathblow to the Illuminati in Bavaria". Weishaupt had fled and documents and internal correspondence, seized in 1786 and 1787, were subsequently published by the government in 1787.[10] Von Zwack's home was searched and much of the group's literature was disclosed.[8]	<br><br>
Johann Adam Weishaupt (6 February 1748 C 18 November 1830 ) was a German philosopher and founder of the secret society, the Order of the Illuminati.	<br><br>
Adam Weishaupt was born on 6 February 1748 in Ingolstadt[1][5] in the Electorate of Bavaria. Weishaupt's father Johann Georg Weishaupt (1717C1753) died[5] when Adam was five years old. After his father's death he came under the tutelage of his godfather Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt[6] who, like his father, was a professor of law at the University of Ingolstadt.[7] Ickstatt was a proponent of the philosophy of Christian Wolff and of the Enlightenment,[8] and he influenced the young Weishaupt with his rationalism. Weishaupt began his formal education at age seven[1] at a Jesuit school. He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768[9] at age 20 with a doctorate of law.[10] In 1772[11] he became a professor of law. The following year he married Afra Sausenhofer[12] of Eichstatt.	<br><br>
After Pope Clement XIV’s suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, Weishaupt became a professor of canon law,[13] a position that was held exclusively by the Jesuits until that time. In 1775 Weishaupt was introduced[14] to the empirical philosophy of Johann Georg Heinrich Feder[15] of the University of Gottingen. Both Feder and Weishaupt would later become opponents of Kantian idealism.[16]	<br><br>
On May day 1776 Johann Adam Weishaupt founded the "Illuminati" in the Electorate of Bavaria. He adopted the name of "Brother Spartacus" within the order. Even Encyclopedia references vary on the goal of the order, such as New Advent saying the Order was not egalitarian or democratic internally, and sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society;[18] while others like Collier's have said the aim was to combat religion and foster rationalism in its place.[19]	<br><br>
The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies. Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know: a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.[18]	<br><br>
Weishaupt was initiated into the Masonic Lodge "Theodor zum guten Rath", at Munich in 1777. His project of "illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice" was an unwelcome reform.[18] He used Freemasonry to recruit for his own quasi-masonic society, with the goal of "perfecting human nature" through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. Presenting their own system as pure masonry, Weishaupt and Adolph Freiherr Knigge, who organised his ritual structure, greatly expanded the secret organisation.[18]	<br><br>
Contrary to Immanuel Kant's famous dictum that Enlightenment (and Weishaupt's Order was in some respects an expression of the Enlightenment Movement) was the passage by man out of his 'self-imposed immaturity' through daring to 'make use of his own reason, without the guidance of another,' Weishaupt's Order of Illuminati prescribed in great detail everything which the members had obediently to read and think, so that Dr. Wolfgang Riedel has commented that this approach to illumination or enlightenment constituted a degradation and twisting of the Kantian principle of Enlightenment.[20] Riedel writes: 'The independence of thought and judgement required by Kant ... was specifically prevented by the Order of the Illuminati's rules and regulations. Enlightenment takes place here, if it takes place at all, precisely under the direction of another, namely under that of the "Superiors" [of the Order].[21]	<br><br>
Weishaupt's radical rationalism and vocabulary was not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of Karl Theodor, Elector of Bavaria, in 1784. Weishaupt lost his position at the University of Ingolstadt and fled Bavaria. 	<br><br>
