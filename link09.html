If George W. Bush's foreign policy was a testament to the perils of overreaction, Barack Obama's foreign policy is becoming, to many experts, a testament to the dangers of underreaction. On the matter of Syria, in particular, fear of renewed U.S. involvement in the problems of dysfunctional Arab countries (a legitimate fear, of course) kept the Obama administration from trying to shape the Syrian opposition, and therefore the outcome of that country's ruinous civil war. The Syrian war is not Obama's fault (people in Washington have a tendency to think that Washington matters more than it does, and they also have a tendency to avoid holding Arab countries accountable for their own disasters), and he has had his victories in Syria―most notably, the removal of most of Bashar al-Assad's chemical-weapons stockpile. But Syria is a catastrophe, and our Syria policy is a hash, and the U.S. is not winning its struggle against ISIS, and is no longer much interested in removing Assad from power.	<br><br>
Our own policy dysfunctions matter a great deal in all of this, David Rothkopf argues in his latest book, National Insecurity: American Leadership in an Age of Fear. Rothkopf, the preeminent historian and analyst of the crucially important and usually misunderstood National Security Council (NSC), argues that, “It is not strategy to simply undo the mistakes of the recent past.” (This is a corollary to an observation Hillary Clinton made not long ago about Obama administration foreign policy.) 	<br><br>
Rothkopf was an acidic critic of the Obama administration's policy-formulation process long before such criticism became the thing that one does in Washington. Writing in the Financial Times, Edward Luce says that Rothkopf's new work "could lay claim to being the definitive book on how 9/11 affected US foreign policy."	<br><br>
PublicAffairs	<br><br>
I interviewed Rothkopf recently about his beliefs and findings. Here is a transcript of our conversation. 	<br><br>
Jeffrey Goldberg: You're an expert on the organization and purpose of the NSC. Why are most national security advisors―Brent Scowcroft being one obvious exception―perceived to be failures? Susan Rice is in the barrel right now, but she's not the first.	<br><br>
David Rothkopf: I'm not sure I agree with that characterization. While the job is tough and a clear lightning rod for criticism given its importance, proximity to the president, and the number of hot-button issues its occupants must tackle, it really can't be said that most of its occupants can be perceived as failures. Rice's immediate predecessor, Tom Donilon, was certainly not perceived that way―getting a mixed grade, perhaps, but hardly a failing one. His predecessor, Jim Jones, was not seen as a success, but that was largely because he was undercut by a coterie of staffers close to the president and, indirectly, by a president who didn't fully empower him or back him up. Steve Hadley was quite successful, actually, as Bush's national security advisor, helping with the benefit of a largely new team elsewhere in the administration to enable Bush to change course in his last couple of years and finish much stronger than he had started.	<br><br>
Condi Rice oversaw a deeply troubled period in U.S. foreign policy in Bush's first term, but that was largely attributed to the president enabling others in the administration, notably the vice president and the secretary of defense, to gain too much traction and to backdoor the interagency process. Sandy Berger was quite a successful national security advisor in the Clinton second term. Tony Lake, not as successful―he was, like Rice and Jones, an example of a "learning curve" national security advisor, overseeing the process while his boss was getting his sea legs―but he was not seen as a failure. His greatest challenge, in some respects, was that his predecessor, Scowcroft, was seen as the gold standard in the job. You can go back further through history and pick out others who were seen as capable, like Colin Powell or Frank Carlucci, and some who were seen as particularly strong, like Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger. So it is a mixed bag.	<br><br>
JG: Your answer suggests that success in this job is derivative, meaning that if a president is prepared to meet the challenges, his national security team will look good, not dysfunctional. Maybe there's only so much she can do.	<br><br>
DR: If there are lessons to be drawn from this track record, they include the fact that it's harder to be the first national security advisor of a president with little foreign-policy experience and, in the end, more broadly, the national security advisor is really only ever as good as his or her president enables him or her to be. 	<br><br>
If the president knows what he wants, is committed to respecting the policy-formation process and entrusting it to the national security advisor and his or her team, and fully empowers the national security advisor, the advisor has a good chance of being successful. This is a job that's not mentioned in the Constitution, not described at length in the National Security Act of 1947 that formed it, and therefore is largely whatever the president wants it to be. A national security advisor with a committed, trusting, experienced president is always more likely to be successful―although if the national security advisor lacks the right traits, experience, relationship with colleagues inside and outside the government, etc., then even with the backing of the president, they can and will fail. The fact is, I think your question largely flows from the fact that right now, under President Obama and Susan Rice, we are in the midst of a particularly dysfunctional period for the NSC.	<br><br>
JG: So this is really about Obama, in your mind?	<br><br>
DR: If Obama had any material management or foreign-policy experience prior to coming in to office or if he had the character of our stronger leaders on these issues―notably a more strategic than tactical orientation, more trust in his team, less risk aversion, etc.―she would be better off, as would we all. But his flaws are compounded by a system that lets him pick and empower those around him. So, if he chooses to surround himself with a small team of "true believers" who won't challenge him as all leaders need to be challenged, if he picks campaign staffers that maintain campaign mode, if he over-empowers political advisors at the expense of those with national-security experience, that takes his weaknesses and multiplies them by those of the team around him.	<br><br>
And whatever Susan Rice's many strengths are, she is ill-suited for the job she has. She is not seen as an honest broker. She has big gaps in her international experience and understanding―Asia. She is needlessly combative and has alienated key members of her staff, the cabinet, and overseas leaders. She is also not strategic and is reactive like her boss. So whereas the system does have the capability of offsetting the weaknesses of a president, if he is surrounded by strong advisors to whom he listens and who he empowers to do their jobs, it can also reinforce and exacerbate those weaknesses―as it is doing now.	<br><br>
Whatever Susan Rice's many strengths are, she is ill-suited for the job she has.	<br><br>
There have been signs of dysfunction in this administration from earlier. Jim Jones was never really given a chance as the president's first national security advisor, being cut out by a small group of former Obama campaign members. The first Afghan review was convoluted. And the memoirs of Panetta, Gates, Clinton, Vali Nasr, and others pointed to other issues, whether with the president, or with exclusion of cabinet members. But matters began to deteriorate last year.	<br><br>
JG: Go into this dysfunction you're talking about in greater depth. Is the “red line” with Syria crisis the moment you thought that the current process was dysfunctional?	<br><br>
DR: Even before the Syria red-line fiasco, there was confusion around how to respond to the overthrow of the Morsi regime in Egypt―marked by poor communications between the State Department and the White House. You also had the fumbled response to the National Security Agency (NSA) scandal that involved lying to and alienating allies; the very weak response to Putin in Crimea that also involved miscommunications between the White House and the State Department; the failure to respond to ISIS when it was clearly emerging as a major threat almost a year ago (remember, it took Fallujah in the beginning of 2014); the self-inflicted wound of touting the Bowe Bergdahl release; and the president's own communications gaffes associated with the process, from his assertion that his guiding principle was "don't do stupid shit" to his assertion that he didn't have a strategy versus ISIS. And, most recently, we have the poorly managed, strategy-less mission against ISIS that is unfocused, inadequate to the challenges, and has already revealed major rifts with the Defense Department's military and civilian leadership.	<br><br>
All administrations make errors. No process is perfect. But here, everything you look for in a high-functioning process―a national security advisor seen as an honest broker among cabinet departments; the full inclusion and empowerment of the cabinet to harness the resources of the administration; the formulation of good policy options for the president; the effective implementation of the choices the president makes; the effective communication of White House positions; the formulation of strategic perspectives (a role really only the White House can do); the effective separation of political and national-security decision-making processes ... good management, good execution, good results―all of that has been missing or disappointing.	<br><br>
Barack Obama doesn't get a zero on foreign policy by any means. He gets a C or a low C.	<br><br>
It's as poorly functioning an NSC process as we have seen since Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney back-doored the process in the early years of the Bush administration, or, perhaps, since the Reagan years, the acknowledged nadir of NSC performance. What is especially distressing, however, is that this dysfunction is coming in year six of the administration, at a time when most two-term administrations actually start to perform better. Unfortunately, President Obama's process is actually regressing.	<br><br>
JG: Compelling case, but two questions come to mind: Am I wrong to say that this is far from the most disastrous foreign-policy presidency we've had, post-World War II? The second question is, can anyone possibly manage this process anymore? Information―good and bad―comes in unceasing waves. I'm thinking of what [Deputy National Security Advisor] Tony Blinken [now nominated to be deputy secretary of state] told you for your book about the exponential increase in constant, unceasing communication. Even if the NSC were to manage this process successfully, how would anyone know? Do you think this can be slowed down―or would having a grand strategy do the slowing for you? (i.e., If you're not buffeted from issue to issue all the time because you have a target on the horizon, would that help significantly? Or is this just a matter of events upending everything?)	<br><br>
DR: It's too early to say whether it is far from the most disastrous foreign-policy presidencies we've had post-World War II. It is certainly not among the best. Among the worst we have some strong choices―Vietnam was calamitous (although, today, Vietnam is more market-oriented and friendly to the West than we might have thought possible back then, and we did win the Cold War so we achieved our goals to a greater extent than we thought we had in the 1970s). The first term of the Bush administration was a mess and the invasion of Iraq was particularly ill-conceived and damaging. Iran-Contra marks a low point for the NSC's operations.	<br><br>
Will we someday say our impulse to pull out of the Middle East and our failure to effectively confront the rise of militant extremism or the adventurism of Putin unleashed prolonged instability and real damage to American interests? Possibly. A new administration in 2016 might reverse our stance quickly or, someday, history might say it was really beyond our ability to control events linked to longer term trends.	<br><br>
But I don't think being the worst or just being average is really what we should focus on now. That's for historians benefiting from the perspective of time. The real question is, are we doing the best that is possible? Is the system working well? Are we making unnecessary mistakes? Can we, by understanding the origins of those mistakes, do better? I think we can. Even in the face of the kind of avalanche of information to which Tony referred or the growing complexity, speed of events, and overall volatility of the planet, we could certainly avoid the self-inflicted wounds of gaffes that offend allies, mismanagement that alienates key parts of the U.S. government and key appointees of the administration, dithering and convoluted decision processes that produce late action and contradictory or halfway measures, and the failure to follow through on promises or actions―from the Cairo speech to the invasion and pull-out from Libya, now in flames.	<br><br>
JG: Do you think I'm overvaluing grand strategy?	<br><br>
DR: Grand strategy would help, of course. It is useful to have a course. America does best when its foreign policy is aspirational, linked to our desire for growing peace, prosperity, stronger alliances, a healthier planet, than when it is reactive as it has been for the past several years. Frankly, setting aside dreams of grand strategy and the kind of playbook we had in the Cold War that did make many foreign-policy decisions easier, as Brent Scowcroft recently pointed out to me, how about just having clearly defined national interests and a discussion about medium-term strategy, rather than the reactive, tactical, politically driven small-think that has dominated the "don't do stupid shit" era?	<br><br>
JG: Given the tone of your comments, I'm not sure you have an answer for this, but: Can you name something good the Obama administration has done overseas? I have some achievements in mind, but I'd rather not lead the witness.	<br><br>
DR: The Obama administration has done a number of good things overseas―far too many to list here. But the idea behind the pivot to Asia was excellent (even if the execution has been spotty in the second term). His early speeches set an important tone; coordination with the European Union during the economic crisis was vitally important―their export-promotion team including the Export-Import Bank and the Department of Commerce especially have done a great job; approving LNG exports was a good idea; the Syria chemical deal reduced a specific threat; he got Osama bin Laden and other key terrorists, which was a positive; helping to get rid of Qaddafi was good, even if the post-crisis Libya results have been pretty awful; the political deal they just struck in Afghanistan was not easy and should be stabilizing for at least a while. He put together a pretty good team in the first term. In short, Barack Obama doesn't get a zero on foreign policy by any means. He gets a C or a low C.	<br><br>
Some of his failures and missteps may have greater long-term negative consequences than the gains. It remains to be seen. But what is indisputable is that especially during his second term the quality of the policy process has deteriorated and the errors and gaffes have added up and, seemingly, accelerated. Right when he should be getting stronger, refreshing his team, learning from his errors, he doesn't seem to be doing so. But there are still two years left. Hopefully between bad results and the elections and a glance at the calendar he will see that time is ticking away, and that if he wants a successful international legacy, he may have to embrace changes and approaches he has resisted to date.	<br><br>
JG: I've noticed, as have you, a tendency by the president to analyze events from the podium. Is this sort of public analysis a good thing? It's high-level analysis, but does it help the public orient itself around an issue? Or does it convey detachment, rather than leadership?	<br><br>
DR: President Obama's tendency to "analyze from the podium" is, as you suggest, a mixed bag. It shows his thought process and often reveals his great intelligence. It also looks like he is improvising, doesn't have a clear worldview or strategy and does not have a policy process that is preparing him properly.  It's a kind of academic trait, one you would expect in a professor. It would be tolerable from him if he were a better manager, had a more disciplined policy process, had a more diverse team that he actually listened to, and if he had more faith in the ability of the United States to engage internationally and in so doing advance our national interests.	<br><br>
The Power Brokers	<br><br>
By I. M. Destler 	<br><br>
From our September/October 2005 Issue 	<br><br>
The birth of the National Security Council did not exactly make the headlines. When the National Security Act established the NSC in 1947, The New York Times gave top billing to the creation of a new post of secretary of defense. Only on page 2 did the story get around to mentioning that "the legislation also provides for a National Security Council," composed of the most senior national security officials, whose "meetings will be presided over by the President."	<br><br>
In the half century since, the NSC has become a central institution -- in important ways, the central institution -- of U.S. foreign policymaking. And over this period, its basic character has changed: from a council of senior cabinet members deliberating with the president to a group of White House staff members headed by the assistant to the president for national security affairs, known as the national security adviser. Over the years, the NSC has increased the power of the NSA and the president but weakened those cabinet members without strong ties to the man in the Oval Office. All told, the advent of the NSC represents one of the most important organizational innovations of the U.S. government since 1945.	<br><br>
In its early years, the NSC was the subject of dozens of scholarly and journalistic analyses. More recently, however, it has received little serious treatment, even as it has become entrenched as the presumptive center of presidential foreign policymaking. A comprehensive book on the NSC's origins and evolution is thus very much needed.	<br><br>
David Rothkopf presents Running the World as just such a book -- The Inside Story of the National Security Council and the Architects of American Power. And in part, he delivers on this promise. Rothkopf has interviewed, on the record, all the most important NSAs since the late 1960s: Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Frank Carlucci, Colin Powell, Anthony Lake, Sandy Berger, and Condoleezza Rice. (He also had an informative conversation with the late Andrew Goodpaster, President Eisenhower's staff secretary for national security.) Extensive quotations from these and many other important players are the strongest element of the book, illuminating how policymaking really happens. Rothkopf quotes no fewer than 50 former officials, all of whom he interviewed between May and September 2004. For these conversations alone, anyone with an interest in the process of foreign policymaking will want this book on his or her shelf.	<br><br>
As a comprehensive analysis of its topic, however, the book falls short. Rothkopf provides lots of raw material -- page upon page of relevant stories and insights -- but no clear set of conclusions or even a general idea of how everything adds up.	<br><br>
MISTAKES AND OMISSIONS	<br><br>
Rothkopf declares in his introduction that "the primary focus of this story is the post-Cold War period in the life of the National Security Council." Perhaps, but it takes him over half the book to get there. This is unfortunate because the post-1989 chapters (plus the chapter on the Reagan era) are the best in the book. The earlier experience is less accessible through interviews, and it shows.	<br><br>
There are also needless errors. Rothkopf twice includes the International Labor Organization among the multilateral institutions created after World War II: one click on "About Us" at the organization's Web site would have told him that it was founded in 1919 under the Treaty of Versailles. He writes that McGeorge Bundy (NSA to John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson) was succeeded in 1966 by "his deputy Walt Rostow"; in fact, Rostow had left the NSC for the State Department in November 1961, to be replaced as deputy by Carl Kaysen, a key player who goes unmentioned. Rothkopf is similarly careless about NSC staff numbers: he states on page 84 that "Bundy cut his staff from 71 to 48," then on page 85 that "Bundy reduced it in size from several scores of staff aides to about eleven." He is also inconsistent about the number of aides who served Henry Kissinger.	<br><br>
More important, Rothkopf misses the fundamental change that was initiated under Kennedy and confirmed under Richard Nixon. For its first 13 years, the NSC was staffed by career civil servants who managed interagency policy planning. Under Kennedy, these men (and few if any women) were replaced by aides appointed to serve a specific president, whose job was not planning but day-to-day issue management. Every administration since has followed the Kennedy model. (When Scowcroft resumed the post of NSA during the George H.W. Bush administration, Rothkopf tells us, he instructed his predecessor, Colin Powell, "to tell his staff that they were all fired unless [he] particularly asked them to stay.")	<br><br>
When the NSC was founded, President Harry Truman was quite happy with his secretary of state, George Marshall. He was even happier with Marshall's successor, Dean Acheson. He found the NSC helpful mostly as a forum for deliberation among his cabinet secretaries and for coordination across departments (particularly the State Department and the Pentagon). But the NSC's role was expanded under Kennedy. Although Clark Clifford and Averell Harriman were important ad hoc policy players as senior White House staff members under several presidents, their roles were nothing like those of the NSAs from Kennedy's presidency onward.	<br><br>
Eisenhower was more committed to the NSC and met with it virtually every week that he was in Washington. He created the position of special assistant for national security affairs (H. R. Haldeman would remove "special" from the title in 1969) and tasked its initial occupant, Robert Cutler, with developing a comprehensive policy-planning process in which papers were drafted by senior departmental officials with NSC staff support, then debated at council meetings, and finally promulgated as policy to guide (but not dictate) day-to-day decisions. For the here and now, Ike had Goodpaster, a no-profile aide who brought people and intelligence together as the president required. Because Rothkopf interviewed Goodpaster, and because he draws on a good (though unabashedly pro-Eisenhower) book by Robert Bowie and Richard Immerman (Waging Peace), he gets the Eisenhower story basically right. But because he seems to have read little else in the policy literature covering the period, he succumbs to Eisenhower hagiography -- as inadequate a view of the complex 34th president as was his earlier denigration.	<br><br>
Rothkopf's failure here is particularly costly to his treatment of Kennedy, whose key role in shaping the modern NSC he misses almost entirely. Kennedy, as Rothkopf correctly notes, picked Bundy as his NSA without any specific idea of what Bundy would do, and together they dismantled the Eisenhower NSC structure without fully understanding it (contributing to, among other things, the Bay of Pigs disaster). But Kennedy's changes, as refined later in his administration, established a new NSC-based presidential advisory structure that has endured to the present. This structure has three elements: a senior-ranking NSA who manages current issues for the president, a staff recruited for the specific administration, and a White House situation room that provides the technical capacity to monitor departmental communications, particularly those of the State Department. In his 1968 campaign, Nixon talked about restoring Ike's NSC and denounced the "catch-as-catch-can talkfests" of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, but it was Kennedy's structure that Nixon built on and formalized once in office.	<br><br>
As the story moves on, Rothkopf runs through the basics. He depicts the extreme centralization of the NSC under Nixon and Kissinger, the conflict between Cyrus Vance and Brzezinski under Jimmy Carter, and the six years of disarray under Reagan. Rothkopf's obvious sympathy for Brzezinski causes him to ignore the connection between Brzezinski's controversial performance as NSA and Reagan's initial decision to downgrade the position. But he is right about the abysmal performance of the system under the Great Communicator. Reagan's hands-off style made it impossible for his NSAs to manage the bitter conflict between Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger -- paving the way to the Iran-contra affair and the near collapse of the administration. The NSC was then reorganized according to the biting critique of the Tower Commission, whose three members -- former Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John Tower, former and future NSA Brent Scowcroft, and former Senator and Secretary of State Edmund Muskie -- took specific senior officials to task for their failings.	<br><br>
The administration of George H.W. Bush was notable for its collegial and productive policy process, with Secretary of State James Baker and NSA Scowcroft playing complementary roles. Clinton NSAs Lake and Berger retained the basic interagency coordinating structure -- a cabinet-level "principals committee" chaired by the NSA and a "deputies committee" below it for ongoing issue management -- put in place by their predecessor. In the current Bush administration's first term, NSA Rice succeeded in staving off a reported effort by Vice President Dick Cheney to chair the principals committee himself. But, as Rothkopf notes, the administration's policymaking process remains highly unbalanced: Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld have managed to keep a heavy "thumb on the scales" of high-level deliberations, particularly on critical issues such as Iraq.	<br><br>
POLICYMAKING VERSUS POLICY	<br><br>
Running the World is only partly about the process of policymaking and the NSC. At many points, there is a book about policy struggling to break free. The chapter about the NSC's origins, for example, is preceded by one contrasting the multilateralist approach chosen by U.S. leaders in the wake of World War II with Bush-Cheney unilateralism in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001. The final chapter, aptly titled "U.S. Foreign Policy in the Age of Ambiguity," devotes barely 3 of its 29 pages to conclusions about policymaking, and many more to Rothkopf's views about how policy has gone wrong under Bush's leadership. As a result, the book provides no synthesis, no serious effort to generalize from 58 years of NSC experience.	<br><br>
If Rothkopf had provided a thoroughgoing analysis of policymaking, he would have focused not mainly on substantive issues (multilateralism versus unilateralism, for example), but rather on how decisions are made and implemented (was Bush provided with a full analysis of the pros and cons of abandoning the Kyoto Protocol or of invading Iraq with thin international support?). Since the NSC's performance is central to these process questions, one would like a book on the council to focus persistently, not intermittently, on the way each administration's NSA and supporting staff affected how issues were managed. And one would like it to draw from the broad variety of NSC experience some lessons about what works best. But Rothkopf fails to do either.	<br><br>
This leaves unanswered several fundamental questions. What, for example, should be the role of the NSA within the overall policy process? A substantial literature, unplumbed by Rothkopf, explores this topic. According to the consensus that had developed by 1980, the NSA should be the president's principal aide on foreign policy -- an honest broker among other officials, a driver of the policy process, and an overseer of policy implementation -- but should have a low profile and a limited operational role, avoiding too many public appearances and advocacy on controversial issues. But Scowcroft -- in many ways the exemplar of this tradition -- departed sharply from this style when he pressed for a forceful response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. And Lake, Scowcroft's successor, said at a 1999 Brookings Institution-University of Maryland roundtable on the role of the NSA that he had "made a mistake the first six months in office when I tried too much to be just an honest broker. I remember Colin Powell coming to me and saying that I needed to give my own views more push."	<br><br>
What about public appearances? Rothkopf acknowledges that Berger "adopted a more visible public presence" during Clinton's second term but does not address the pros and cons of this change. He might have noted that Brzezinski's public advocacy did much to undercut his credibility as an honest broker, whereas Rice's more frequent public appearances as NSA did not cause the same problem since she was generally presenting established presidential policy.	<br><br>
Should the NSA act as a negotiator? Pointing to Kissinger's diplomacy, Rothkopf argues that it "would [have been] a ridiculous waste of a vital asset" to prevent him from conducting important negotiations himself. But Rothkopf neglects the cost of letting him do so: with Kissinger handling all the main issues, other U.S. diplomats were undercut and the management of the policy process was neglected.	<br><br>
What about the size of the NSC staff? The conventional view is that it should be kept small. At points, Rothkopf seems to disagree: "The impulse to overstreamline staffs needs to be resisted." The staff has grown, he argues, "because the role of the NSC has grown as the scope of issues it must keep track of for the president has grown. It's a genie that won't go back into the bottle." Yet later Rothkopf claims that Rice's "eighty-person NSC" was at a disadvantage competing with Cheney's smaller, more "ideologically cohesive" staff. And in his passionate closing critique of the Bush administration's unilateralism, Rothkopf argues that terrorism "poses a threat quantum levels of scale beneath that of the Cold War."	<br><br>
So what, then, is the increase in the "scope of issues" that requires close to 100 professionals on today's NSC staff? The Department of Homeland Security and the White House Homeland Security Council have taken primary responsibility for domestic terrorist threats, and the newly created National Economic Council coordinates economic policy. Might it be that bureaucratic and political forces have led to the bloating of staffs, as well as the inflation of titles, in the White House and across the federal government?	<br><br>
Rothkopf's most fundamental limitation is his failure to address the relationship between process and policy. He writes about both but does not do enough to connect the two -- and thus he fails to show the reader why the NSC really matters. One finishes Running the World applauding the author's ambition and grateful for how much of the NSC story he tells. But we still need a book that pulls it all together.	<br><br>

鲁炜在中美互联网论坛演讲：共识大于分歧 合作多于争端	<br><br>
发表时间：2014-12-03 	<br><br>
第七届中美互联网论坛当地时间2日在美国首都华盛顿举行。中国国家互联网信息办公室主任鲁炜发表题为《沟通中互信合作中共赢》的主旨演讲 ，指出两国在网络空间共识大于分歧，合作多于争端，并就中美互联网交流提出五点主张。全文如下： 	<br><br>
沟通中互信合作中共赢 	<br><br>
――在第七届中美互联网论坛上的主旨演讲 	<br><br>
（2014年12月2日） 	<br><br>
鲁炜 	<br><br>
尊敬的凯瑟琳・诺维利女士， 	<br><br>
尊敬的克瑞格・蒙迪先生、沈向洋先生， 	<br><br>
尊敬的邬贺铨先生， 	<br><br>
大家上午好！今天，来自中美互联网领域的政府代表和业界精英齐聚华盛顿，共同迎来了第七届中美互联网论坛的开幕。我谨代表中国国家互联网信息办公室，对论坛的召开表示热烈的祝贺！对论坛主办方微软和中国互联网协会表示由衷的感谢！ 	<br><br>
去年以来，中国国家主席习近平与奥巴马总统把握大势、放眼未来，从加州安纳伯格“庄园会”，到北京中南海“瀛台会”，就共同构建中美新型大国关系达成重要共识，得到国际社会高度评价和广泛认同，推动两国关系进入了崭新的历史阶段。随着互联网突飞猛进的发展，中美网络关系受到前所未有的重视和关注，已经从商业的合作、民间的沟通，上升为两国交往的重点、各方关注的焦点，成为中美新型大国关系的重要内容，很大程度影响着两国的未来。新时期的中美网络关系，总体向好、稳步向前，但前进途中时有坎坷，主要呈现两大特征： 	<br><br>
一是深度融合、利益攸关。中美两国在网络空间你中有我、我中有你，已经成为密不可分的发展共同体、利益共同体、命运共同体。中国是美国互联网企业的最大境外市场，几乎所有的美国知名互联网企业都在华享有巨额收益，高通公司一半利润来自中国，苹果设备新增用户一半来自中国，美国有近千家投资基金把中国作为重点，触角遍布中国互联网各领域，占外资投入的一半以上，美国企业的兴衰与中国市场紧紧相连。美国是中国互联网企业境外上市的主要目的地，中国互联网企业在美上市近50家，总市值近5000亿美元，美国股民分享了中国互联网市场发展的红利。最近，阿里巴巴在美上市，创造了全球史上最大规模的IPO，融资总额超过250亿美元，有专家分析认为，美国股民投给阿里巴巴的不仅仅是资金，更是对中国互联网的信心、对中国市场的信心、对中国未来的信心。 	<br><br>
二是存在分歧、时有摩擦。昨天，我乘机从北京到华盛顿，横跨太平洋，飞行万余公里。我想，如此遥远的距离，如果没有往来，哪会产生分歧？正是因为中美互联网融合得越来越深，交流得越来越广，联系得越来越紧，我们的不同点才容易被放在放大镜和聚光灯下，加上文化的差异，一些问题自然就出现了分歧。比如，在网络空间治理上，美方讲“多利益相关方”，中方讲“多边”，这本来并不矛盾，没有“多边”，哪来“多利益相关方”的那个“方”呢？因为概念的不同而刻意夸大分歧，不仅无益于中美网络关系，也无益于世界互联网的共治和发展。 	<br><br>
深度融合，因为充满信心；存在分歧，说明缺乏信任。有信心，却缺信任，这是当前中美网络关系中躲不开、绕不过的问题。中国古代有一则寓言故事叫“疑人偷斧”，讲的是从前有个人丢了一把斧子，他怀疑是邻居家的人偷走了，就暗地里观察。他看那个人走路的姿势，脸上的表情，说话的语气，一举一动都像是偷了斧子的样子。可过了几天，他在自家院子里找到了那把斧子，才想起是自己遗忘在院子里了。这时候他再看邻居家的人，怎么看都不再像偷了斧子的样子。这个看似简单的故事告诉我们，信任是多么可贵、多么重要，如果人与人之间缺乏信任，带着主观的偏见去看待他人，真实也会被误解为虚假，美好也会被幻化为丑恶。 	<br><br>
纵观20年中美互联网交流发展史，双方尽管存在一些分歧，但是可以得出以下基本判断：我们在网络空间共识大于分歧，合作多于争端。习近平主席指出，志同道合是伙伴，求同存异也是伙伴。我们可以有分歧，但我们不能没有沟通；我们可以有争论，但我们不能没有信任。我们不能被乱花迷眼，也不能被浮云遮眼，而要端起历史规律的望远镜去细心观望。我们应当看到，中美两国合则两利，而且是多方获益；斗则两伤，甚至是伤害世界。中美应坚持正确的义利观，寻求更多利益汇合点，做朋友而不是对手，做真朋友而不是假朋友。我们应当看到，中国梦与美国梦在本质上是相通的，是和平、发展、合作、共赢的梦，我们追求的是中美人民的福祉，也是各国人民共同的福祉。我们应当看到，中美在网络空间共识是主流、合作是主流，我们不仅要求同存异，更要求同共进，让互联网给人类带来和平和安全，让互联网不给犯罪和恐怖主义提供渠道，让互联网有助于未成年人的成长，让互联网更多服务发展中国家的利益，因为他们更需要互联网，这也正是互联网发展的要义。我们应当看到，互联网把世界变成了地球村，大交流、大发展、大融合是时代的潮流，共享共治是历史的选择，谁也阻挡不了，谁也改变不了，只有顺势而为，相向而行，才能把握时代脉搏，更好地创造和引领人类的未来。为了共同的美好未来，我们愿与大家分享五点主张： 	<br><br>
一、彼此欣赏而不是互相否定。互联网诞生于美国，从美国走向世界，这是美国为人类进步作出的重大贡献。中国是全球最大的互联网市场，有400万家网站，6亿多网民，世界互联网企业前10强中国有4家，今年仅电子商务交易额一项预计将达到2万亿美元，而且还将以每年30%的速度增长。几天前，我在网上看到百度、阿里巴巴、京东等公司的三季度财报，营业收入增幅均超过50%，这样的增幅在全世界都是少有的。如此巨大的成就，充分说明中国的互联网是开放的，说明中国的管理是有序的，说明中国的改革开放是成功的，说明中国人民选择的中国道路是正确的，说明中国共产党的领导是坚强有力的。我们不仅需要为相同而欢呼，更需要因不同而互鉴，各美其美，美人之美，美美与共，欣赏对方的优点，借鉴彼此的经验，而不是去否定对方、改变对方。 	<br><br>
二、互相尊重而不是对立指责。国无大小，都是平等的。在网络空间，应当彼此尊重网络主权，彼此尊重对互联网治理模式的选择，彼此尊重在网络领域的重大关切，彼此尊重在网络文化上的差异，深入沟通，增进理解，扩大共识。20年来，中国互联网发展的实践证明，凡是外国企业在中国赢得市场、赢得用户、赢得效益的，无一例外地尊重中国的市场环境，无一例外地遵守中国的法律法规。特别是美国企业在华发展的鲜活案例告诉我们，选择了尊重，就能把握机遇，深深融入中国互联网创新发展的洪流，创造出无限的价值；选择了对立，就会偏离轨道，把自己孤立起来，最终被市场所抛弃。 	<br><br>
三、共享共治而不是独善其身。习近平主席提出，要建立多边、民主、透明的国际互联网治理体系，共同构建和平、安全、开放、合作的网络空间。这已成为国际网络空间治理的重要共识。大国之大，不是权力之大，而是责任之大。网络空间也许不会因为大国之间的和睦而和睦，但一定会因为大国之间的不信任，而乱象丛生、混乱不堪。作为负责任的大国，决不能为了自身发展而遏制别国发展，决不能为了自身安全而侵犯别国安全。而且，离开了国际网络空间的安全和发展，任何国家的绝对安全、一枝独秀也都是不存在的。只要我们登高望远，热情拥抱网络空间共享共治的新时代，我们就一定能够把发展的多样性，转化为推动世界互联网发展的无穷活力和强大动力，让我们的后代真正受益于网络给人类社会带来的伟大变革。 	<br><br>
四、沟通互信而不是相互猜疑。中国是全球网民最多的国家，我们更清楚和平安全的网络空间是多么可贵；中国是网络攻击的主要受害国，我们更明白网络安全是多么重要。中国政府一贯反对任何形式的网络攻击。在网络安全问题上，中美应更多地沟通，更多地互信，共同打击网络犯罪、网络攻击、侵犯隐私等行为，共同保护知识产权，严厉打击网络恐怖主义，让互联网成为阿里巴巴的宝库，而不是潘多拉的魔盒。我坚信，只要我们拿出智慧和勇气，网络安全不仅不会成为中美关系的分歧点，而且会成为中美合作的新亮点。 	<br><br>
五、合作共赢而不是零和博弈。中国互联网发展的20年，是与美国互利共赢、融合共生的20年。中美互联网在市场规模、运营机制、技术水平、人才培养等方面存在差异，但差异不能成为合作的障碍。正是因为我们有广泛的差异性，我们才拥有更强的互补性，我们才拥有合作共赢的无限可能。当最大的发达国家与最大的发展中国家互信合作，当最现代的西方文明与最悠久的中华文化相互碰撞，当最先进的信息技术与最广阔的网络市场水乳交融，中美互联网领域的合作前景一定比太平洋还要宽广! 	<br><br>
女士们、先生们、朋友们， 	<br><br>
华盛顿有句名言，“衡量朋友真正的标准是行动而不是言语。”中国人也讲，“行胜于言”。只要我们行动起来，在沟通中互信，在合作中共赢，就一定能够不断开创中美互联网的美好未来，为推动中美新型大国关系发展、造福两国乃至世界人民作出历史性贡献！ 	<br><br>
鲁炜，中国互联网的守门人	<br><br>
2014 年 12 月 2 日	<br><br>
香港――周二，当一次重要的中美互联网大会在华盛顿召开时，中国共产党一名负责宣传工作的中年官员将与众多科技行业高管、美国官员和网络名人汇聚一堂。	<br><br>
这名官员名叫鲁炜，或许看起来与这里格格不入，实际上却肯定会引起关注。作为中国互联网监管领域的新领导，他是美国互联网企业进入利润丰厚的中国市场的掌门人，也是强硬的新网络政策的代表。在这项新政策中，中国宣称自己有权屏蔽网站、审查内容，以及追踪境内用户的活动。	<br><br>
对美国人而言，这可能意味着微妙地走钢丝。但是对于鲁炜来说，这是他发挥的时刻，而那些认识他的人也认为，他会充分利用这一机遇。	<br><br>
54岁的鲁炜习惯发表充满套话的枯燥演讲，与那些创建了网络行业的新一代商人迥然不同。然而，他负责监管这一行业，并与这些人进行着频繁的斗争。	<br><br>
不过，在升任中国互联网掌门人的过程中，他展现出了对网络和社交媒体的力量拥有精准的认识，同时也证明了自己擅长一门历史更悠久的艺术――通过操纵舆论来使共产党获益。	<br><br>
鲁炜在2013年接管国家互联网信息办公室，并于今年5月成为以国家主席习近平为首的一个权力很大的互联网领导小组的负责人。自那以后，他进一步加强了中国网络审查的力度，而它原本就是世界上最繁复的网络审查制度。	<br><br>
通过在一系列私人会议上发布严厉警告，以及发起严格限制一些人网上账户的行动――已导致一位网络名人被捕――他给中国相对自由的社交媒体上的活跃人物套上了枷锁。在他的监管下，政府加大了屏蔽国外网站的力度，并颁布了新的规定，限制社交媒体上的分享功能，加强对流行视频网站的审查。	<br><br>
今年6月，在伦敦的一次贸易会议上，他理直气壮地为中国需要进行更严格的网络控制进行辩护。10月，在北京的一次新闻发布会上，他又直白地表示，Facebook不能指望在中国不受限制的运营。	<br><br>
“我既没有说它不可以进入中国，也没有说它可以进入中国，”鲁炜称。“外国互联网企业进入中国，我们的底线就是要符合中国的法律法规。我们现在不能允许的是，既占了中国市场，挣了中国的钱，还来伤害中国。”	<br><br>
上个月，他爱发声、说话直、好热闹的风格在主办中国首届世界互联网大会时显露无疑。参加这次会议的有中国政界人士、国内顶尖互联网企业的负责人，以及许多西方大型科技公司的高管。	<br><br>
会议在以白墙建筑为特色的水乡乌镇召开。他与一位古巴电信官员一起抽雪茄，穿着运动服在乌镇快走运动，还为了火速赶往邻近的杭州市迎接总理李克强而取消了一次演讲。	<br><br>
曾与鲁炜见面的一个人说，“他扎下了帐篷，试图让每个人都进来。”	<br><br>
“他非常自信，是个明确无误的政客，”此人表示。因为与鲁炜会面属于私密性质，他不愿公布身份。“他吸烟、喝酒、睡得晚、起得早，是个工作狂。他就像马戏团的总指挥，想要成为一切工作的中心，同时处理无数事情，而且他对此相当擅长。”	<br><br>
鲁炜还传达了一条信息，预计那些本周在华盛顿出席中美互联网论坛的人也将会听到。他反复呼吁，在互联网方面“尊重国家主权”，声称各国有权根据自身的意愿，管理境内的网络。	<br><br>
这个立场与人权组织和商业利益团体所宣扬的观点产生了冲突。前者认为，自由的网络表达是一项基本权利，而后者呼吁，互联网和科技企业应该享有平等的市场机遇。	<br><br>
职业生涯的早期，鲁炜曾在官方媒体新华社的广西分社担任社长。在这个职位上，他善于表现的天赋引起了北京总部的注意。尤其值得一提的是，外出的领导抵达机场时，他会确保有一辆公务车到飞机的舷梯下迎接。	<br><br>
不久，他先后升任新华社的秘书长和副社长。2011年，他被提拔为北京市副市长、市委宣传部部长。	<br><br>
在那里，他开始阐述自己对互联网的看法。2010年7月，他在共产党的理论刊物《求是》上发表了一篇文章，提出中国应该加强对信息通过互联网等新技术进行国际传播的控制。	<br><br>
在解释了“虚假、歪曲的信息，会误导资本、扰乱市场”后，他还表示，“没有信息安全，就没有交易安全，就没有金融安全和经济安全，也就没有完全意义上的国家安全。”	<br><br>
这篇文章一定程度上点明了后来在中国领导层当中不断蔓延的一种忧虑：社交媒体拥有动摇政府的潜质。当年晚些时候爆发的“阿拉伯之春”提供了具体的例子。	<br><br>
2011年，有关温州动车相撞事故的报道扩散开来，表明中国的社交媒体能够避开本国的审查制度。2013年，美国国家安全局(National Security Agency)前承包商雇员爱德华・J・斯诺登(Edward J. Snowden)泄露了美国政府的监控项目，揭示出中国等国家非常容易遭到网络窃听。	<br><br>
去年，仍在北京市政府任职的鲁炜敦促该市六万名宣传官员更好地利用微博等社交媒体。新华社报道，鲁炜建议大家“看微博，开微博、发微博，研究微博。”	<br><br>
“鲁炜是合适的人选，在适当的时候担起了合适的职位，”牛津大学的研究学者罗希尔・克里米尔斯(Rogier Creemers)说。“掌管宣传部门的传统官员有点太守旧。他们需要的是懂得自己在谈些什么的聪明人。突然之间，有人公开表明态度，展现出他了解网络和社交媒体，以及它在国际社会的发展动态。”	<br><br>
执掌国家互联网信息办公室时，鲁炜面临的第一轮挑战中，就包括对中国拘束较少的社交媒体进行管控。他多次在北京的奢华餐厅宴请社交媒体中的知名人士，并让这些活动获得了广泛报道。这些人俗称“大V”，得名于账户经过认证。其中一些人拥有成百上千万的关注者，已展现出能将强制拆迁和环境问题等敏感话题转变成令共产党不快的全国性讨论的本事。	<br><br>
鲁炜警告他们要为自己的行为负责。后来，他又在全国性电视节目中直白地要求八名知名网友发布更加积极的内容。	<br><br>
过不了多久，知名大V、美籍商人薛必群(Charles Xue)因为嫖娼的指控被关押了八个月。不过，官方媒体的一系列报道几乎毫无疑问地表明，是他的网络言论激怒了政府。	<br><br>
通过关停账户或限制账户功能，鲁炜清除了部分大V。在与其他一些大V共进晚餐时，他告知了进一步的后果，威胁的意味显而易见。	<br><br>
分析人士表示，中国的最高法院去年裁定，帖子被转发500次以上，就可以追究原作者可能涉及的法律责任，而鲁炜是这一规定的幕后策划者。鉴于散播虚假传言属于犯罪行为，该规定意味着，任何人发布传播较广但却具有破坏性的帖子，均将承担责任，面临牢狱之灾。	<br><br>
分析人士表示，此类举措引起了国家主席习近平的注意，让他当上了新组建的中央网络安全和信息化领导小组的办公室主任。该小组由习近平亲自牵头，负责加大网络管控力度，加强对外国网络攻击的防范，以及研发新技术。	<br><br>
分析人士称，这个小组计划制定一份政策文件。文件将力求平衡，既能满足政府进一步审查国内社交媒体并封锁外国网站的需要，又能为经济发展提供足够的开放空间。	<br><br>
记者给鲁炜办公室发送了传真就本文寻求评论，但没有收到回复。他目前着眼于一个更大的目标：在国际网络监管方面，为中国赢得举足轻重的话语权。他主办乌镇会议主要就是为了实现这一目标，在华盛顿，他也很可能大谈这一问题。	<br><br>
然而，在乌镇会议中，他遭遇了必须诉诸外交手腕而不是政府的高压手段的时刻。这说明了他的方法存在局限性。	<br><br>
在最后一晚的深夜，一份声明草案被塞入了与会者所在房间的门缝里，其中呼吁尊重各国的网络主权。文件称，提交反馈及修改意见的截止时间为上午8点。这似乎是为了让它赶在最后时刻获得通过。	<br><br>
一名与会人员表示，在第二天举行的闭门会议中，几名西方代表提出了抗议，但鲁炜坚称，一些与会者赞同这一文件，因此这应该被视为共识。由于会议属于私密性质，此人要求不具名。	<br><br>
进一步的讨论并没有达成一致，鲁炜出了名的争强好胜此时现出了端倪。他拒绝妥协，在没有达成自己期望的闭幕声明的情况下，离开了会议现场。	<br><br>
“会上气氛非常紧张，”上述与会人员表示。“他站起来，直接走了出去，说是自己还有其他会要开。”	<br><br>
希拉里新作微妙展现外交决策之艰	<br><br>
2014 年 6 月 10 日	<br><br>
作为希拉里・罗德姆・克林顿(Hillary Rodham Clinton)可能参与2016年总统竞选的前奏，其新作《艰难抉择》(Hard Choices)的发布过程如同一次精心策划、逐步推进的军事行动：上个月末，有关班加西事件的章节被“政治人”(Politico)提前泄露（大概是为了尽早结束关于这个热点问题的相关讨论）；接下来是登上最新一期《人物》杂志(People)的封面；本周，电视上将轮番播放相关的访谈；然后是全国范围的马不停蹄的新书推介活动。	<br><br>
这本书本身则是一本精心构思、微妙定位的作品，把这位前国务卿和前第一夫人，以举足轻重的政策专家的形象呈现了出来。与其2003年的回忆录《亲历历史》(Living History)――该书总是沦为政治演说似的巧舌如簧的声明，或是大力回击各种对手对她和丈夫的辛勤工作的指责――相比，《艰难抉择》就像一位政治家撰写的大作，意在证明她在国家安全和外交政策方面的广泛经验。书中几乎没有什么新信息。与前国防部长罗伯特・M・盖茨(Robert M. Gates)极为直白的回忆录《职责》(Duty)不同，从这本书来看，克林顿保留了所有政治选项的可能性――并且希望外界知道，自己不仅熟谙外交的艺术，更拥有成为“首席决策官”的政治韬略。	<br><br>
如同克林顿在国务院的任期一样，《艰难抉择》并没有提出一个包罗万象的宏大外交政策愿景――这曾是亨利・A・基辛格(Henry A. Kissinger)在其1994年的著作《大外交》(Diplomacy)中的做法。相反，克林顿采用了一种罗列事实的务实手法。一些评论人士认为，她在国务卿任内颇为保守，没有像达成中东和平协议那样的丰功伟绩。而这本新书（写作过程中得到了被她称为“书籍团队”的协助）展示出，克林顿的主要政治遗产在于，在全球化、科技发达的21世纪，重新设定了美国外交政策的方向，以及在乔治・W・布什(George W. Bush)政府的伊拉克战争和单边主义之后，帮助恢复了美国的海外形象。	<br><br>
这本书和《亲历历史》的少数共同点包括，两者都强调克林顿是一个善于成长和改变的人：她在书中表示，自己从过去的错误中吸取了教训，比如2002年对授权在伊拉克采取军事行动的提案投赞成票的做法。（她“做错了”，写到那次投票时，她说。“简单明了。”）《艰难抉择》似乎意在同时达到几个目的：回顾克林顿作为国务卿的任期；反思2008年失败的总统竞选；覆盖她作为第一夫人那段混乱时期的记忆（“白水事件”、莱温斯基）；以及助其超脱华盛顿的党派对立、相互诋毁。	<br><br>
克林顿只在一个章节中呈现出自我辩护或不服气的意思。这一章讲到了2012年导致四名美国人在利比亚班加西死亡的那次袭击――众议院共和党人仍在对此进行调查，坚称奥巴马和克林顿隐瞒了他们了解的袭击缘由。她写道，“我不会参与拿死去的人做文章的政治斗争。”	<br><br>
克林顿一直都是一个勤奋的优等生，而《艰难抉择》的内容以国家（中国、俄罗斯、伊朗等）、地区（中东、亚洲、拉丁美洲）和话题（阿拉伯之春、气候变化和人权）为主题，进行了清晰的安排。尽管她没有丈夫的那种娓娓道来的天赋（他在2011年出版的经济方面的著作《回归工作》[Back to Work]中多有展示），她还是为普通读者――以及潜在的支持者――简明扼要且不失巧妙地分析了世界舞台上错综复杂的政治、经济和历史因素，以及美国领导人在“核心价值”和战略关切之间寻求平衡时的各种困难。她的笔触平和而有节制，时不时穿插幽默之笔，比如叙述俄罗斯领导人弗拉基米尔・V・普京(Vladimir V. Putin)邀请比尔・克林顿(Bill Clinton)参加追踪北极熊的考察活动。	<br><br>
在书中，一些较为积极的事件得到了详尽的描述，比如针对伊朗的外交和经济孤立，而在无人机战争和国家安全局(National Security Agency)的数据搜集项目等更具争议性的话题上，则只是一笔带过。对于密切关注政界的读者而言，不会从书中得到多少关于奥巴马政府处理阿富汗战争或反恐政策等方面的新信息。	<br><br>
对那些对政策不怎么感兴趣的读者，书中也点缀了一些巧克力复活节彩蛋般的个人趣事。克林顿告诉读者，为了对付时差，她有时会用一只手的指甲去戳另一只手的手掌；她没有把美国突袭奥萨马・本・拉登(Osama bin Laden)秘密住所的计划告诉丈夫（“他们让我不要告诉任何人，所以我没有告诉任何人”）；在一次国际会议开始之前，奥巴马总统把她叫到一边，她以为要讨论什么敏感问题，结果奥巴马小声对她说，“你牙上有东西。”	<br><br>
外界普遍认为，克林顿的观点往往比奥巴马更加强硬。在相关章节中，她在担任奥巴马的忠诚助手和阐述自己观点之间小心翼翼地保持着平衡。她对普京采取强硬路线，她写道，“难对付的人带来艰难的选择”，“力量和决心”是这名俄罗斯领导人唯一懂得的语言。关于她提出的为叙利亚温和反对派提供武器和训练的建议未被采纳一事，她写道：“没人愿意在辩论中失败，我也是。但这是总统的决定，我尊重他的考虑和决定。”	<br><br>
谈及国务院和白宫幕僚之间被广泛报道的紧张关系时，克林顿在书中列举了她和他们的一些分歧――包括在开罗街头抗议增多之后，奥巴马向埃及总统胡斯尼・穆巴拉克(Hosni Mubarak)施压要求其下台时，但她建议奥巴马保持谨慎。她还写道，看到老友理查德・霍尔布鲁克(Richard Holbrooke)被年轻的白宫幕僚边缘化和排挤时，她感到很痛心。克林顿曾经任命这位资深外交官负责阿富汗和巴基斯坦事务，而这些白宫幕僚不喜欢他张扬的、老式的风格。	<br><br>
关于自己的打算――是否竞选总统――克林顿写道，她尚未做出决定。这是她将面对的“又一个艰难抉择”。	<br><br>
麦家笔下中国间谍小说的心理焦虑	<br><br>
2014 年 5 月 8 日	<br><br>
麦家原名蒋本浒，他也许是你没听说过的、最畅销的作家。他1981年进入中国的一所军校就读，毕业后留在军中撰稿、做编辑。1997年转业之后，他写了很多军事情报题材的小说，销量上千万。有些被改编成了热门电视剧和电影。如今，麦家是政府资助的浙江省作协的主席。	<br><br>
麦家的第一部小说（也是第一部即将以英文出版的小说）《解密》讲述的是容金珍的故事。容金珍脑袋奇大，令母亲难产而死。这个孤儿小时候沉默寡言，蓬头垢面，可能还有点自闭症，但是长大后人们发现他是个白痴天才，他的数学才能得到另一位天才的磨砺。这位天才名叫林・希伊斯，是个波兰犹太裔访问教授，他以乔治・维纳切的笔名偷偷撰写反共产主义的长篇檄文，秘密担任以色列和X国的军事情报分析员。X国指的是美国，在穷凶极恶的超级代码世界里，美国是中国的主要对手。	<br><br>
1956年，一个神秘的中国机构把金珍安置到特别单位701工作，那是一个隐秘的政府大院，专门用于研究密码。他在那里破解了紫码，不过他不知道紫码是希伊斯发明的，希伊斯当时已经去了X国。金珍被称为“革命英雄”，701给他树立了一个巨大的雕像，很像罗丹的《思想者》(The Thinker)。共产党很感激他，为了给他找老婆，给他安排了一个又一个女警卫，直到其中一个与他擦出火花。	<br><br>
但是金珍一点也不愉快。他说的、写的、做的一切都被监视、记录。他意识到安保的目的不是保护他，而是保护他脑袋里的国家秘密。他的人际关系停滞了，他的大脑却在疯狂地更加向内心旋转。37岁时他迷上了另一个代码，他“就剩了一具躯壳”，那个能让他“更接近疯狂和天才”的“疯子的工作”让他变疯了。	<br><br>
麦家的小说极少给我们展示真实的解密或间谍工作。它最吸引人的地方――真的是让人爱不释手――来自对容金珍的心理分析以及扣人心弦的情节、诡异的气氛和夸张的细节。	<br><br>
麦家继承了中国早期小说的很多传统，学者们将很喜欢一层层拨开这本小说中的谜团。某些章节的结束语意在挑起读者对即将发生的事情的兴趣，跟中国小说家们几百年来的惯用手法一样。同样地，在可以追溯到15世纪甚至更早的“公案”故事讲述中，梦境可以揭示真相――所以，在《解密》中，希伊斯做了个梦，梦见自己在几千里之外，看见金珍开始从事密码研究。麦家对现代技术的魔力的痴迷与中国在20世纪初出版的“理想小说”相呼应，当时的中国作家们想象出了各种能让自己的国家跳跃进入现代社会的发明。《解密》对人物心理的兴趣似乎源于五四运动时代（20世纪初至30年代），当时的作家们乐于探究弗洛伊德和其他西方学者的各种观念。金珍巨大的脑袋和奇异的家庭背景很像苏童和余华等当代作家的描述风格，作者偶尔采用的超小说手法则是效仿近些年的一些后现代风格。	<br><br>
不过，这部小说最明显借鉴的是20世纪50年代进入中国的苏联“反间谍”小说。人们最初看到的是苏联小说的中译本，但是中国作家们很快开始自己编写反间谍小说。“文革”期间，甚至连反间谍小说在政治上也不够纯洁，不能出版，所以人们只能在家手头抄写，非法流传。这种体裁的主要元素全都出现在《解密》中，包括对国防的盲目崇敬，奇怪的外国人，漂亮的小玩意，以及一层又一层隐藏的事实，其中有些事实最终也没有揭示。	<br><br>
鉴于麦家在中国军队的个人经历――很明显包括一些情报工作――人们自然想知道他写的东西有多少是真实的。我觉得不多。保密意识和仇外情绪在中国的军队亚文化群中肯定是很强烈的，但是《解密》中精彩的故事讲述显然更多地来自文学传统，而非生活。	<br><br>
举个例子：战后金珍在701的地址只有简单的“36号邮箱”。持异见的中国天体物理学家方励之在自传中提到，他在20世纪50年代中期被派往一个秘密地点工作（研究原子弹），上头指示他只能告诉所有人自己的地址是“北京546号邮箱”。单看这一点，两者的描述反映了同一个事实。但是围绕金珍的地址出现了难以捉摸的谜团，而方励之写道，他的物理学家同行们不费吹灰之力就搞清了546号邮箱实际上在哪里，然后开始拿它开玩笑。“你要回546号邮箱啦？”他起床离开房间时，他们会这样问他。“这些话传到了我们的保密官员那里，”方励之回忆说，“他一再严肃地警告我不要把地址泄露出去。”方励之总是面无表情地答应。他的描述道出了事情的真相；相比之下，麦家的描述更像是吊人胃口的奇谈。	<br><br>
为了在中国出版，麦家必须在共产党允许的范围内写作。他做得很巧妙，即使他不得不时常地歪曲历史（比如，在他的小说里，1949年后外国教授还可以自由出入中国，这在现实中肯定是不可能的）。在一些敏感问题上他采用了共产党更喜欢的说法（比如称1949年为“解放”）；在1949年之后的讲述中，他把“党”和“国”相提并论，表明不爱党是不可能爱国的。	<br><br>
麦家有时也想打破界限，比如他提到了解放后出现的自我审查，而且毫不掩饰地描述了“文革”时期的迫害。有些句子无疑引起了审查局的注意，比如“坦白地说……容金珍被党利用了”。不过，在我看来，他对共产党做法最明显的抵制在于他选择忽略的那些东西。他完全没有提到“为人民服务”、五年计划和大跃进等，尽管他写的那个时代充斥着共产党的这些骄傲的说法。好像他和读者们达成了一个无声的协议：不提这些吹捧，只讲故事。	<br><br>
