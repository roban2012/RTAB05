<a href= "link05.html">君士坦丁堡（Constantinople）争夺战</a><br><br>
<a href= "link09.html">National Security Council</a><br><br>

Here is the complete list from Alinsky.	<br><br>
* RULE 1: “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.” Power is derived from 2 main sources C money and people. “Have-Nots” must build power from flesh and blood. (These are two things of which there is a plentiful supply. Government and corporations always have a difficult time appealing to people, and usually do so almost exclusively with economic arguments.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 2: “Never go outside the expertise of your people.” It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. (Organizations under attack wonder why radicals don’t address the “real” issues. This is why. They avoid things with which they have no knowledge.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 3: “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.” Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 4: “Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.” If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. (This is a serious rule. The besieged entity’s very credibility and reputation is at stake, because if activists catch it lying or not living up to its commitments, they can continue to chip away at the damage.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 5: “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. (Pretty crude, rude and mean, huh? They want to create anger and fear.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 6: “A good tactic is one your people enjoy.” They’ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They’re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. (Radical activists, in this sense, are no different that any other human being. We all avoid “un-fun” activities, and but we revel at and enjoy the ones that work and bring results.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 7: “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.” Don’t become old news. (Even radical activists get bored. So to keep them excited and involved, organizers are constantly coming up with new tactics.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 8: “Keep the pressure on. Never let up.” Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. (Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 9: “The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. (Perception is reality. Large organizations always prepare a worst-case scenario, something that may be furthest from the activists’ minds. The upshot is that the organization will expend enormous time and energy, creating in its own collective mind the direst of conclusions. The possibilities can easily poison the mind and result in demoralization.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 10: “If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.” Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. (Unions used this tactic. Peaceful [albeit loud] demonstrations during the heyday of unions in the early to mid-20th Century incurred management’s wrath, often in the form of violence that eventually brought public sympathy to their side.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 11: “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.” Never let the enemy score points because you’re caught without a solution to the problem. (Old saw: If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. Activist organizations have an agenda, and their strategy is to hold a place at the table, to be given a forum to wield their power. So, they have to have a compromise solution.)	<br><br>
 * RULE 12: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions. (This is cruel, but very effective. Direct, personalized criticism and ridicule works.)	<br><br>

Reveille for Radicals (1946); Rules for Radicals (1971) 	<br><br>
Saul David Alinsky (January 30, 1909 C June 12, 1972) was an American community organizer, and writer. He is generally considered to be the founder of modern community organizing. He is often noted for his book Rules for Radicals.	<br><br>
In the course of nearly four decades of political organizing, Alinsky received much criticism, but also gained praise from many public figures. His organizing skills were focused on improving the living conditions of poor communities across North America. In the 1950s, he began turning his attention to improving conditions in the African-American ghettos, beginning with Chicago's and later traveling to other ghettos in California, Michigan, New York City, and a dozen other "trouble spots".	<br><br>
His ideas were adapted in the 1960s by some US college students and other young counterculture-era organizers, who used them as part of their strategies for organizing on campus and beyond.[5] Time magazine once wrote that "American democracy is being altered by Alinsky's ideas," and conservative author William F. Buckley said he was "very close to being an organizational genius."[4]	<br><br>
Early life 	<br><br>
Saul David Alinsky was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1909 to Russian Jewish immigrant parents, the only surviving son of Benjamin Alinsky's marriage to his second wife, Sarah Tannenbaum Alinsky.[6] Alinsky stated during an interview that his parents never became involved in the "new socialist movement." He added that they were "strict Orthodox, their whole life revolved around work and synagogue ... I remember as a kid being told how important it was to study."[4]	<br><br>
Because of his strict Jewish upbringing, he was asked whether he ever encountered antisemitism while growing up in Chicago. He replied, "it was so pervasive you didn't really even think about it; you just accepted it as a fact of life."[4] He considered himself to be a devout Jew until the age of 12, after which time he began to fear that his parents would force him to become a rabbi.	<br><br>
I went through some pretty rapid withdrawal symptoms and kicked the habit ... But I'll tell you one thing about religious identity...Whenever anyone asks me my religion, I always say―and always will say―Jewish.[4]	<br><br>
At the same time, he was also an agnostic.[7][8][9]	<br><br>
Education 	<br><br>
He worked his way through the University of Chicago, where he majored in archaeology, a subject that fascinated him.[4] His plans to become a professional archaeologist were changed due to the ongoing economic Depression. He later stated, "Archaeologists were in about as much demand as horses and buggies. All the guys who funded the field trips were being scraped off Wall Street sidewalks."[4]	<br><br>
Early jobs 	<br><br>
After attending two years of graduate school, he dropped out to accept work for the state of Illinois as a criminologist. On a part-time basis, he also began working as an organizer with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). After a few years, by 1939, he became less active in the labor movement and became more active in general community organizing, starting with the Back of the Yards and other poor areas on the South Side of Chicago. His early efforts to "turn scattered, voiceless discontent into a united protest" aroused the admiration of Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, who said Alinsky's aims "most faithfully reflect our ideals of brotherhood, tolerance, charity and dignity of the individual."[4]	<br><br>
As a result of his efforts and success at helping slum communities, Alinsky spent the next 10 years repeating his organization work across the nation, "from Kansas City and Detroit to the barrios of Southern California." By 1950 he turned his attention to the African American ghettos of Chicago. His actions later aroused the hatred of Mayor Richard J. Daley, who also acknowledged that "Alinsky loves Chicago the same as I do."[4] He traveled to California at the request of the San Francisco Bay Area Presbyterian Churches to help organize the black ghetto in Oakland. Hearing of his plans, "the panic-stricken Oakland City Council promptly introduced a resolution banning him from the city."[4]	<br><br>
Community organizing and politics 	<br><br>
In the 1930s, Alinsky organized the Back of the Yards neighborhood in Chicago (made infamous by Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel, The Jungle, which described the horrific working conditions in the Union Stock Yards). He went on to found the Industrial Areas Foundation while organizing the Woodlawn neighborhood; IAF trained organizers and assisted in the founding of community organizations around the country.	<br><br>
In Rules for Radicals (his final work, published in 1971 one year before his death), Alinsky addressed the 1960s generation of radicals, outlining his views on organizing for mass power. In the opening paragraph Alinsky writes,	<br><br>
What follows is for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be. The Prince was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. Rules for Radicals is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away."[10]	<br><br>
Alinsky did not join political parties. When asked during an interview whether he ever considered becoming a Communist party member, he replied:	<br><br>
Not at any time. I've never joined any organization―not even the ones I've organized myself. I prize my own independence too much. And philosophically, I could never accept any rigid dogma or ideology, whether it's Christianity or Marxism. One of the most important things in life is what Judge Learned Hand described as 'that ever-gnawing inner doubt as to whether you're right.' If you don't have that, if you think you've got an inside track to absolute truth, you become doctrinaire, humorless and intellectually constipated. The greatest crimes in history have been perpetrated by such religious and political and racial fanatics, from the persecutions of the Inquisition on down to Communist purges and Nazi genocide.[4]	<br><br>
He did not have much respect for mainstream political leaders who tried to interfere with growing blackCwhite unity during the difficult years of the Great Depression. In Alinsky's view, new voices and new values were being heard in the U.S., and "people began citing John Donne's 'No man is an island.'"[4] He observed that the hardship affecting all classes of the population was causing them to start "banding together to improve their lives," and discovering how much in common they really had with their fellow man.[4]	<br><br>
Alinsky once explained that his reasons for organizing in black communities included:	<br><br>
Negroes were being lynched regularly in the South as the first stirrings of black opposition began to be felt, and many of the white civil rights organizers and labor agitators who had started to work with them were tarred and feathered, castrated―or killed. Most Southern politicians were members of the Ku Klux Klan and had no compunction about boasting of it.[4]	<br><br>
Alinsky's tactics were often unorthodox. In Rules for Radicals he wrote,	<br><br>
[t]he job of the organizer is to maneuver and bait the establishment so that it will publicly attack him as a 'dangerous enemy.'" According to Alinsky, "the hysterical instant reaction of the establishment [will] not only validate [the organizer's] credentials of competency but also ensure automatic popular invitation."[11]	<br><br>
As an example, after organizing FIGHT (an acronym for Freedom, Independence [subsequently Integration], God, Honor, Today) in Rochester, New York,[12] Alinsky once threatened to stage a "fart in" to disrupt the sensibilities of the city's establishment at a Rochester Philharmonic concert. FIGHT members were to consume large quantities of baked beans after which, according to author Nicholas von Hoffman, "FIGHT's increasingly gaseous music-loving members would hie themselves to the concert hall where they would sit expelling gaseous vapors with such noisy velocity as to compete with the woodwinds."[13] Satisfied with his threat yielding action, Alinsky later threatened a "piss in" at Chicago O'Hare Airport. Alinsky planned to arrange for large numbers of well-dressed African Americans to occupy the urinals and toilets at O'Hare for as long as it took to bring the city to the bargaining table. According to Alinsky, once again the threat alone was sufficient to produce results.[13] In Rules for Radicals, he notes that this tactic fell under two of his rules: Rule #3: Wherever possible, go outside the experience of the enemy; and Rule #4: Ridicule is man's most potent weapon.	<br><br>
Alinsky described his plans for 1972 to begin to organize the white middle class across America, and the necessity of that project. He believed that what President Richard Nixon and Vice-President Spiro Agnew then called "The Silent Majority" was living in frustration and despair, worried about their future, and ripe for a turn to radical social change, to become politically active citizens. He feared the middle class could be driven to a right-wing viewpoint, "making them ripe for the plucking by some guy on horseback promising a return to the vanished verities of yesterday."[4] His stated motive: "I love this goddamn country, and we're going to take it back."[4]	<br><br>
Legacy and honors 	<br><br>
The documentary, The Democratic Promise: Saul Alinsky and His Legacy, states that "Alinsky championed new ways to organize the poor and powerless that created a backyard revolution in cities across America."[14] Based on his organizing in Chicago, Alinsky formed the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) in 1940. After he died, Edward T. Chambers became its Executive Director. Hundreds of professional community and labor organizers, and thousands of community and labor leaders have been trained at its workshops. Fred Ross, who worked for Alinsky, was the principal mentor for Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Other organizations following in the tradition of the Congregation-based Community Organizing pioneered by IAF include PICO National Network, Gamaliel Foundation, Brooklyn Ecumenical Cooperatives, founded by former IAF trainer, Richard Harmon and Direct Action and Research Training Center (DART).[15][16][17]	<br><br>
Several prominent American leaders have been influenced by Alinsky's teachings,[16] including Ed Chambers,[14] Tom Gaudette, Ernesto Cortes, Michael Gecan, Wade Rathke,and Patrick Crowley.[18][19] Alinsky is often credited with laying the foundation for the grassroots political organizing that dominated the 1960s.[14] Jack Newfield writing in New York magazine included Alinsky among "the purest Avatars of the populist movement," along with Ralph Nader, Cesar Chavez, and Jesse Jackson.[20]	<br><br>
Biographer Sanford Horwitt has claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama was influenced by Alinsky and followed in his footsteps as a Chicago-based community organizer. Horwitt asserted that Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign was influenced by Alinsky's teachings.[21] Thomas Sugrue of Salon.com writes, "Obama worked for the Developing Communities Project (DCP) of the Calumet Community Religious Conference (CCRC), a group on Chicago’s South Side whose tactics ... were inspired by Alinsky." [22]	<br><br>
Adam Brandon, a spokesman for the conservative non-profit organization FreedomWorks, one of several groups involved in organizing Tea Party protests, says the group gives Alinsky's Rules for Radicals to its top leadership members. A shortened guide called Rules for Patriots is distributed to its entire network. In a January 2012 story that appeared in The Wall Street Journal, citing the organization's tactic of sending activists to town-hall meetings, Brandon explained, "his [Alinsky's] tactics when it comes to grass-roots organizing are incredibly effective." Former Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey also gives copies of Alinsky's book Rules for Radicals to Tea Party leaders.[23]	<br><br>
In 1969, Alinsky was awarded the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award.	<br><br>
Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals is the late work of community organizer Saul D. Alinsky, and his last book, published in 1971 shortly before his death. His goal for the Rules for Radicals was to create a guide for future community organizers to use in uniting low-income communities, or "Have-Nots", in order to empower them to gain social, political, and economic equality by challenging the current agencies that promoted their inequality.[1] Within it, Alinsky compiled the lessons he had learned throughout his personal experiences of community organizing spanning from 1939-1971 and targeted these lessons at the current, new generation of radicals.[2]	<br><br>
Divided into ten chapters, each chapter of Rules for Radicals provides a lesson on how a community organizer can accomplish the goal of successfully uniting people into an active organization with the power to effect change on a variety of issues. Though targeted at community organization, these chapters also touch on a myriad of other issues that range from ethics, education, communication, and symbol construction to nonviolence and political philosophy.[3]	<br><br>
Though published for the new generation of counterculture-era organizers in 1971, Alinsky's principles have been successfully applied over the last four decades by numerous government, labor, community, and congregation-based organizations, and the main themes of his organizational methods that were elucidated upon in Rules for Radicals have been recurring elements in political campaigns in recent years.	<br><br>
Inspiration for Rules for Radicals 	<br><br>
The inspiration for Rules for Radicals was drawn directly from Alinsky’s personal experiences over the course of his career as a community organizer.[1] It was also taken from the lessons he learned from his University of Chicago professor, Robert Park, who taught him to see communities as “reflections of the larger processes of an urban society”.[3] The methods he developed and practiced across the country were placed directly into the book as a guide on future community organizing for the new generation of radicals emerging from the 1960s.[3][4]	<br><br>
Alinsky believed heavily in collective action as a result of the work he did with the C.I.O and the Institute for Juvenile Research in Chicago where he first began to develop his own, distinct method of community organizing. Additionally, his late work with the Citizens Action Program (CAP) provided some of his most whole and conclusive practices in organizing through the empowerment of the poor, though not well-known. Saul Alinsky understood community structure and the impoverished and the importance of their empowerment as a successful element of community activism and used both as tools to create powerful, active organizations.[5] He also used shared social problems as external antagonists to “heighten local awareness of similarities among residents and their shared differences with outsiders”.[3] Ironically, this was one of Alinsky’s most powerful tools in community organizing; to bring a collective together, he would bring to light an issue that would stir up conflict with some agency to unite the group. This provided an organization with a specific “villain” to confront and made direct action easier to implement. These tactics as a result of decades of organizing efforts, along with many other lessons, were poured into Rules for Radicals to create the guidebook for community organization.[2]	<br><br>

Themes 	<br><br>
In Rules for Radicals, several themes persist throughout Alinsky’s lessons to future community organizers. The most notable is his use of symbol construction to strengthen the unity within an organization.[3] Often, he would draw on loyalty to a particular church or religious affiliation to create a firmly structured organization with which to operate. The reason being that symbols by which communities could identify themselves created strongly structured organizations that were easier to mobilize in implementing direct action. Once the community was united behind a common symbol, Alinsky would find a common enemy for the community to be united against.	<br><br>
The use of common enemy against a community was done to promote another theme of Rules for Radicals, nonviolent conflict as a uniting element in communities.[6] Alinsky would find an external antagonist to turn into a common enemy for the community within which he was operating. Often, this enemy would be a local politician or agency that had some involvement with activity that was causing detriment to the community. His goal was to unite a group through conflict with an external antagonist. Once the enemy was established, the community would come together in opposition of it. This management of conflict heightened awareness within the community as to the similarities its members shared as well as what differentiated them from those outside of their organization.[3] The use of conflict also allowed for the goal of the group to be clearly defined. With an established external antagonist, the community’s goal would be to defeat that enemy, whether it be a politician, policy, or opposing agency.[3]	<br><br>
Symbol construction helped to promote structured organization, this allowed for nonviolent conflict through another strong element in Alinsky’s teaching, direct action. Direct action created conflict situations that further established the unity of the community and promoted the accomplishment of achieving the community’s goal of defeating their common enemy.[2] It also brought issues the community was battling to the public eye. Alinsky encouraged over-the-top public demonstrations throughout Rules for Radicals that could not be ignored, and these tactics enabled his organization to progress their goals faster than through normal bureaucratic processes.[3]	<br><br>
Lastly, the main theme throughout Rules for Radicals and Alinsky’s work was empowerment of the poor.[5] Alinsky used symbol construction and nonviolent conflict to create a structured organization with a clearly defined goal that could take direct action against a common enemy. At this point, Alinsky would withdraw from the organization to allow their progress to be powered by the community itself, not by Alinsky.[3] This empowered the organizations he worked with to create change for whatever issue they were battling.[2] Symbol construction, nonviolent conflict, direct action, and empowerment of the poor were the main themes of Alinsky’s work in organizer, and whether reading Rules for Radicals, or examining his work directly, they can be distinctly observed within every community he organized.	<br><br>
The rules[1]	<br><br>
1.“Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.” Power is derived from 2 main sources C money and people. “Have-Nots” must build power from flesh and blood.	<br><br>
2.“Never go outside the expertise of your people.” It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone.	<br><br>
3.“Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.” Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty.	<br><br>
4.“Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.” If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules.	<br><br>
5.“Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.	<br><br>
6.“A good tactic is one your people enjoy.” They’ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They’re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones.	<br><br>
7.“A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.” Don’t become old news.	<br><br>
8.“Keep the pressure on. Never let up.” Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new.	<br><br>
9.“The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist.	<br><br>
10.“If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.” Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.	<br><br>
11.“The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.” Never let the enemy score points because you’re caught without a solution to the problem.	<br><br>
12.“Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions	<br><br>
Criticisms 	<br><br>
Despite the effective nature of the lessons passed down in Rules for Radicals, Saul Alinsky has received some criticism for the methods and ideas he presented within his primer. First, it has been noted that much of his instruction has only been effective in urban, low-income areas.[7] This has led some social scientists, such as Robert Pruger and Harry Specht, to criticize his broad statement that Rules for Radicals is a tool for organizing all low-income people. Further, his use of artificially stimulated conflict has been criticized for its ineffectiveness in areas that thrive on unity.[7] In fact, in several Chicago areas in which he worked, his use of conflict backfired, and the community was unable to achieve the policy adjustments they were seeking.[2]	<br><br>
Much of the philosophy of community organization found in Rules for Radicals has also come under question as being overly ideological. Alinsky believed in allowing the community to determine its exact goal. He would produce an enemy for them to conflict with, but the purpose of the conflict was ultimately left up to the community. This idea has been criticized due to the conflicting opinions that can often be present within a group.[7] Alinsky’s belief that an organization can create a goal to accomplish is viewed as highly optimistic and contradictory to his creation of an external antagonist. By producing a common enemy, Alinsky is creating a goal for the community, the defeat of that enemy. To say that the community will create their own goal seems backwards considering Alinsky creates the goal of defeating the enemy. Thus, his belief can be seen as too ideological and contradictory because the organization may turn the goal of defeating the common enemy he produced into their main purpose.[7]	<br><br>
Rules for Radicals has received the same criticism often leveled at Communistic and Socialistic theory, that being, that it is a "movement without a moral".[citation needed] In that sense of amorality, his philosophy is pragmatic, akin to Legal realism and Utilitarianism.	<br><br>
Legacy 	<br><br>
The scope of influence for Rules for Radicals is a far-reaching one as it is a compilation of the tactics of Saul Alinsky. It has been many direct influences in policymaking and organization for various communities and agency groups, as well as indirect influences found in politicians, activists educated by Alinsky and the IAF, and other grassroots movements.	<br><br>
Direct impact 	<br><br>
Despite his passing in 1972, Alinsky’s influence has carried through time to help spawn the creation of numerous other organizations and policy changes since his death. Rules for Radicals was a direct influence that helped to form the United Neighborhood Organization which came to prominence in the early 1980s.[3] Its founders Greg Galluzzo, Mary Gonzales, and Pater Martinez were all students of Alinsky’s who carried the tactics he left in his primer forward in organizing Chicago neighborhoods.[3] The work of UNO helped to vastly improve the hygiene and sanitation situations for southeastern Chicago as well as to improve education standards there as well.[3] Additionally, the founders of Organization of the North East in Chicago during the 1970s also applied Alinsky’s principles to organize multiethnic neighborhoods in order to give the area greater political representation.[3]	<br><br>
The teachings found in Rules for Radicals have also been dispersed by many of Alinsky’s students who not only undertook their own community organizing endeavors, but also taught numerous other grassroots movements the tactics they had been taught. Direct students of Alinsky’s such as Edward T. Chambers took the lessons of Rules for Radicals to help form the Industrial Areas Foundation, the Queens Citizens Organization, and the Communities Organized for Public Service. The most notable of these is the IAF which served as a teaching ground for many community organizers based on Alinsky’s tactics. Another student of Alinsky’s, Ernest Cortez, rose to prominence in the late 1970s in San Antonio while organizing Hispanic neighborhoods. His use of congregation-based organizing received much acclaim as a popular method of Alinsky’s by utilizing “preexisting solidary neighborhood elements, especially church groups, so that the constituent units are organizations, not individuals.”[5] This congregation-based organizing and symbol construction was taught to him by Edward Chambers and the IAF during his time studying under both.	<br><br>
The methods and teachings of Rules for Radicals have also been linked to the Mid America Institute, the National People's Action, the National Training and Information Center, the Pacific Institute for Community Organizations, and the Community Service Organization.[5]	<br><br>
Later influence 	<br><br>
Additionally, the methods taken from Rules for Radicals have also been prevalent in modern American politics. Barack Obama’s most recent primary campaign was noted for featuring strong elements of Alinsky’s organizing techniques.[5] The use of congregation-based organizing has been linked to Jesse Jackson when he was organizing his own political campaign.[8]	<br><br>

《新共和》杂志，与华盛顿抬杠百年	<br><br>
2014 年 11 月 21 日	<br><br>
《新共和》的所有者Facebook的亿万富翁克里斯・休斯 ，《新共和》编辑富兰克林・弗尔	<br><br>
《新共和》(The New Republic)杂志将于周三在华盛顿举办一场正装庆典，庆祝该杂志成立100周年，出席者包括比尔・克林顿(Bill Clinton)与拉斯・巴达・金斯堡(Ruth Bader Ginsburg)。温顿・马萨里斯(Wynton Marsalis)将献上演出，共有400名宾客出席，其中不乏重要人物。	<br><br>
对于那些格外怀旧的人来说，这场派对会令他们想起1984年该杂志那场近乎传奇的70周年庆典，当时的出席者包括巴尼・弗兰克(Barney Frank)、加里・哈特与亨利・A・基辛格(Henry A. Kissinger)。基辛格在餐后讲话上声称，和这么多自由主义者一起合影，让他觉得“很受伤”。	<br><br>
“这些照片就像一声呐喊，”杂志编辑，40岁的富兰克林・弗尔(Franklin Foer)说，人们通过照片可以间接感受到《新共和》身为最热点的政治杂志的时代。“看着他们，再看看如今的华盛顿，就会觉得‘哦，一代不如一代’。”	<br><br>
正如华盛顿的变化，《新共和》杂志也在改变。2012年，Facebook的亿万富翁克里斯・休斯(Chris Hughes)从一个财团手中买下这本杂志，杂志的长期所有者马丁・佩雷兹(Martin Peretz)也在该财团之中。在休斯领导下，这本双周刊的员工扩充了一倍，它重新设计了纸质版，拓宽了报道范围，使其不再像以前那样以华盛顿为中心。它的网络流量也大幅增加，杂志声称，杂志网站每月有400万名用户。	<br><br>
更多变化亦在发生中。周年庆典到来之际，休斯聘请了雅虎新闻的前任执行官，40岁的盖伊・维德拉(Guy Vidra)，他的名字被印在刊头，成了《新共和》的第一位首席执行官。这在华盛顿新闻界引发了一阵推测，一家以残酷的办公室政治斗争和离经叛道的政治报道而闻名的杂志，或许正处于另一场巨变的边缘。	<br><br>
去年，曾为贝拉克・奥巴马(Barack Obama)做过组织工作的休斯推出这本经重新设计的杂志，附有一封编辑致读者信，其中没有提到“自由”或“自由主义”这些词，当时有不少人对此表示疑虑。如今，休斯说自己仍对纸质印刷出版保持忠诚，但也准备好了抛弃“杂志”概念。	<br><br>
“20年前，毫无疑问，它是一本政治杂志，这一点没什么可说的，”休斯在纽约与维德拉共同接受采访时说。“如今，我并不把它称为一本杂志。我觉得我们是一家数字媒体公司。”	<br><br>
休斯放弃了总编地位，但保留出版人这个头衔。有人推测他和维德拉将把这本杂志引向低俗，走向BuzzFeed的方向，他和维德拉否认了这一说法。但他们也说，有可能通过关注更广泛的题材，采取新的数码叙事形式，在网上“走得更好”，为杂志吸引数以千万计的网络读者。	<br><br>
不管《新共和》如今变成了什么样，它仍在忙于利用自己传奇的过去。弗尔和30岁的休斯正忙着宣传《头脑的叛乱》(Insurrections of the Mind)这本文选，它收录了贯穿该杂志历史的50篇文章。长期在杂志工作的自由主义编辑里昂・维塞尔迪尔(Leon Wieseltier)如今已是满头白发，他刚刚为华盛顿国民队的一场比赛开球（他确认“开得又高又远”），后来又上综艺节目《科尔伯特报告》(The Colbert Report)中，探讨“中分头发”的价值。	<br><br>
在佩雷兹暴风骤雨般的30年任期中，有过很多激烈的争吵。周年纪念专刊上，前任编辑亨德里克・赫兹伯格(Hendrik Hertzberg)在一篇文章中以亲切的口吻回忆了这些往事（大部分）。《新共和》得罪了许多左派，其中包括不少自己的员工，它支持尼加拉瓜反共产党的反对派起义者、支持查尔斯・穆雷(Charles Murray)1994年的书《弧线排序》(The Bell Curve)中关于种族与智商的章节，还在事后的反思中全力支持伊拉克战争。去年佩雷兹曾在《华尔街时报》(Wall Street Journal)的专栏文章中攻击休斯，休斯表示没有邀请佩雷兹来参加派对。	<br><br>
最近，《新共和》开始走中立路线，最初的举措就是决定取消社论，有人认为这是一种衰退。	<br><br>
“这家杂志曾经是精神分裂的，”《国家》(The Nation)杂志的专栏作家和佩雷兹的长期批评者埃里克・阿尔特曼(Eric Alterman)说，“但是现在，最好的比喻是，它就像一艘美丽的小帆船，上面总有很漂亮的东西，但是没法带你去往任何地方。”	<br><br>
但其他人说，这家杂志在休斯治理下，开始回归它在进步时代的根源，即实用理想主义。“现在的杂志有更大的公众精神和更广泛的视野，”纽约大学自由主义新闻项目的负责人罗伯特・S・博伊恩顿(Robert S. Boynton)说。“事实上，它的身份引起了一些困惑，这其实是一个健康的信号。”	<br><br>
办公室内的斗争还在继续，但并不总是体现在杂志的版面里。杂志多年的高级编辑约翰・朱迪斯(John Judis)写了一本关于亲以色列游说集团历史的书籍，《新共和》刊登了节选，维塞尔迪尔在一封半私人的电子邮件中尖锐地表达了自己对此感到不快，这封邮件被刊登在保守派的网站“华盛顿自由灯塔”(The Washington Free Beacon)上。	<br><br>
“激烈的争辩是这家杂志非常重要的价值观，”休斯这样评价这场风波，“互相尊重也是如此。”	<br><br>
这对于克林顿先生来说可能是个安慰。周三庆典上的祝酒词中，光是朗读90年代《新共和》就他与希拉里・罗德姆・克林顿(Hillary Rodham Clinton)的报道中的辱骂之词，他就可以马拉松般说上半天。	<br><br>
并不是说《新共和》变得温和了。弗尔说，它只是“减少了自作聪明”，仍然在刊登对共和党与民主党同样严厉的文章。他指的是周年纪念刊上诺姆・谢伯(Noam Scheiber)关于奥巴马的顾问瓦莱丽・贾勒特(Valerie Jarrett)的批评性特写，这篇文章受到很多议论。	<br><br>
在长期处于维塞尔迪尔自治状态下的文化版面，仍然实行无拘无束的批判主义，纪念刊中登出了詹姆斯・沃尔科特(James Wolcott)的一篇文章，欢快地讽刺莉娜・杜汉姆(Lena Dunham)；还有一篇维塞尔迪尔的长文，宣布，“对于我们的体系来说，凶狠和礼貌同等重要。”	<br><br>
维塞尔迪尔还为这期杂志做了总结，在刊尾文章中，他警告那种赋予技术“超越人类存在的至高无上的权威”的做法。	<br><br>
品味《新共和》的老式技巧或许像是在攻击杂志的数码化未来。但维塞尔迪尔否定了这种看法，把自己称为“平台多元论者”。	<br><br>
“这是庆祝的时刻，”他说，“百年以来，如果没有我们，这个国家怕是会更蠢一些。”	<br><br>

《独裁者手册》：天下乌鸦不一般黑	<br><br>
2014 年 6 月 30 日	<br><br>
《独裁者手册》(The Dictator’s Handbook)可真是一部典型的“标题党”作品。根据这个书名，这本书将手把手教会我们如何成为一个呼风唤雨的独裁者。真有这样的秘笈？原以为征服世界需要千军万马，现在看来只需要42元。	<br><br>
可是，掏钱买书之后，打开一读，我们就会发现自己“上当”了。这本书真正的标题似乎应该是《如何理解政治：一个三维的视角》。但是鉴于多数人一读到“三维”这个字眼就睡着了，所以，还是用个吸引眼球的书名、让人们先掏钱再说吧。	<br><br>
但事实上，由来自纽约大学的两位政治学学者布鲁斯・布鲁诺・德・梅斯奎塔(Bruce Bueno de Mesquita)和阿拉斯泰尔・史密斯(Alastair Smith)出版于2011年的书旨在介绍一个理解政治的“三维视角”，并试图以之取代我们常见的“民主专制二分”视角。政治的哪三维？在作者看来，一切统治者掌握和维系权力都要面临三个集团：名义选择人；实际选择人；致胜联盟。所谓“名义选择人集团”，就是那些名义上有投票权的公民；实际选择人集团在某些国家可能是实际的投票人，在另一些国家则可能是党代表大会之类的机构；但这些都不那么重要，真正重要的是最后那个“致胜联盟”――即真正决定一个领导人上台还是下台的那些核心人物――他们可能是神秘的泰国将军，也可能是坐在珠帘后面的慈禧太后，还可能是当年为奥巴马投票的美国选民。如果必须用一句话来总结此书的中心思想，那就是：一个领导人，不管他身处什么样的制度，都只会讨好决定其输赢的那个“致胜联盟”。别幻想什么“为人民服务”了，政治就是“为致胜联盟服务”。	<br><br>
接下来，睡着的读者可以醒过来了――在介绍完他们的政治分析三维模型之后，作者的确提供了一套“统治攻略”。这个“攻略”非常简洁，比“三十六计”还简洁――它只有五条：	<br><br>
第一：让你的致胜联盟越小越好（容易收买和控制）；	<br><br>
第二：让你的名义选择人集团越大越好（备胎越多当然越好）；	<br><br>
第三：掌控收入的分配（无需解释）；	<br><br>
第四：支付给核心支持者刚好足够确保他们忠诚的钱（给多了就威胁到统治者自身）；	<br><br>
第五：不要从你的支持者的袋里挪钱去改善人民的生活（不要试图“为人民服务”，因为背叛“自己人”比背叛“人民”后果更不堪设想）。	<br><br>
总结起来就是：找到尽可能多的钱，给关键但尽可能少的人花。比如，利比里亚的前总统塞缪尔・卡尼翁・多伊(Samuel Kanyon Doe)，这位在1985年刺杀了其前任、并将其心脏喂狗的“壮士”当权之后，无师自通地掌握了上述规则：他迅速控制了一家大橡胶公司、一家铁矿出口公司、并向远洋船只征收“登记管理费”，从而获取了巨大财源；然后他又用这个财源一举将士兵的工资从85美元涨到250美元。同时，他还将政府高层全部换成了本族人。尽管他诸多短视的政策导致这个国家经济崩溃、犯罪丛生、民不聊生，但是没关系，在这里，“致胜联盟”不是“民不聊生”里面的那个“民”，是政府高层与军队。	<br><br>
《独裁者手册》中文版，2014年5月由汉唐阳光人文图书引进出版。	<br><br>
The New York Times (纽约时报)	<br><br>
这个模型的确给我们理解从家庭、企业到政党、国家的组织运转提供了一个强有力的工具。小到一个家庭――宝宝想吃巧克力怎么办？家里人再多，他所需要的搞定的其实就是那个妈妈――那才是他的“致胜联盟”。大到一个专制政府――为什么罗伯特・加布里埃尔・穆加贝(Robert Gabriel Mugabe)把津巴布韦治理得一团糟却能“稳坐江山”？因为他们搞定了需要搞定的人。为什么光绪为了国家前途发动改革却死得那么惨？因为他得罪了自己的“致胜联盟”。为什么联合国无法出兵叙利亚？因为英美搞不定常任理事国这个“致胜联盟”……	<br><br>
把这个模型运用到政治分析时，作者格外强调，这个攻略可不仅仅适用于专制国家或组织，在“找钱搞定致胜联盟”这一点上，民主国家也一样。美国国会的“猪肉政治”就是一个典型。对一个议员来说，本选区那些给他投票的民众就是他的“致胜联盟”。于是，各种“好处”源源不断地往本选区输送，至于这个选区是不是真的需要一个飞机场、这个超市是不是建在另一个选区更好、这笔钱也许路易斯安那赈灾更需要……，我可管不了，因为路易斯安那的选民不会万里迢迢跑到这里给我投票。	<br><br>
那么，难道根据这个“三维模型”，专制和民主是一回事？写到这里，作者终于“背叛”了书名、露出了他们的“本来面目”：他们用了一章试图论证“天下乌鸦一般黑”，然后用了剩下的九章来论证“天下乌鸦不一般黑”。	<br><br>
在作者看来，专制和民主的逻辑是一样的，但同样的逻辑却导致完全不同的结果――原因在于，在专制和民主之下，致胜联盟的规模完全不同。在专制国家，致胜联盟往往很小――极端情况下，几个将军、某党派的核心人物或者某些宗教领袖就能决定谁在台上谁下来；但在民主国家，尽管致胜联盟和名义选择人之间也往往有巨大鸿沟，但其规模要大得多，比如，就奥巴马的上台而言，尽管有投票率、党派撕裂等因素，最后把他推上台的，就算没有上亿，也有几千万人了。	<br><br>
致胜联盟这种规模的差异会带来一系列政策和治理上的后果。致胜联盟规模小，意味着统治者往往只需要给联盟成员提供“私人好处“来获得或维系权力，无需通过公共服务和公共福利来维系权力――这就是掠夺型国家的起源；致胜联盟规模大，则意味着统治者只能通过公共服务和公共福利来争取权力，这是服务型国家的理由。由于即使在民主国家，致胜联盟也不等于“全体人民”，这种公共善的供给未必是均衡的：既然奥巴马的核心支持者是年轻人、有色人种、穷人和自由派知识分子，那么给富人减税、呼吁禁止堕胎、增加大学生学费或者推翻平权法案显然不会占据奥巴马议程的顶端。但是，当致胜联盟规模达到几千万乃至上亿人时，局部的“私”与整体的“公”已经相差不远。	<br><br>
为了说明“大致胜联盟”的治理优势，作者列举了一系列的案例。比如税收。与我们一般认定“民主的再分配冲动导致税收提高”的直觉不同，作者的研究表明，一般情况下，致胜联盟的规模越大，税收越低――这是因为高税收会得罪自己的致胜联盟。比如墨西哥，民主转型前后，边际税率以及政府收入占GDP比重都减少而不是增加了。但在“小致胜联盟国家”，致胜联盟所获得的好处从来主要不是来自于低税收、而是“私人好处”，所以政府很可能用高税收、逆累进或间接税的方式将穷人的钱转移到富人身上。再比如医疗卫生方面，作者的经验研究表明，对于控制婴儿死亡率，致胜联盟的规模比国家贫富程度影响更大，“成为富裕国家确实有助于挽救孩子的生命，但效果不如成为民主国家”。再比如饮清洁用水，90%的洪都拉斯人能喝到清洁的水，却只有44%的赤道几内亚人能喝到清洁的水――是因为洪都拉斯比赤道几内亚富很多吗？事实上赤道几内亚的人均GDP高得多，而且两个国家都在热带，都曾经是西班牙殖民地，导致差异的，在作者看来，是政治制度。大致胜联盟往往意味着统治者试图以更低的税收提供更多的公共服务，所以书中总结道：民主是关于好想法的军备竞赛。	<br><br>
可以看出，作者试图抛弃“民主/专制”二分法来理解政治，代之以他们创造的“三维模型”，但是绕了一大圈，他们似乎还是绕回了这个二分法。只不过，他们使用的语汇不再是“民主/专制”，而是“大致胜联盟/小致胜联盟”。	<br><br>
但是，因为致胜联盟规模较大，民主国家的公众从此就带上了护身符，可以一劳永逸享受统治者端上来的各种甜品吗？显然并非如此。不要忘记前面提及的“红五条”：不管民主制还是独裁制里的统治者，他们总在想方设法缩小致胜联盟、开拓财源、从“人民”手里向自己的致胜联盟输送利益――这就意味着，民主永远面临着被统治者扭曲成专制的可能性。事实上，民主国家无论历史上还是现实中，选区操控（缩小致胜联盟规模）、增税借债（扩大财源）以及猪肉政治（内部分赃）等等危险都一直存在。对此，在本书的开头，作者就讲了加州贝尔小城的腐败故事。在那个小镇，一共有3万6千多人，登记选民只有9000多人，市议会选举的投票率只有20%多，也就是2000多人，由于多党瓜分选票，导致一个议员只需要472票就可以当选。也就是说，在一个3万多人的小镇，只有400多人属于致胜联盟，搞定400多人就可以操控该市的各种政策，腐败随之而来也不足为奇了。但是，如果这个小城有更多的登记选民、选民中有更多出来投票呢？所以，如果专制是统治者缩小致胜联盟的结果，民主则是被统治者奋力扩大致胜联盟的结果。在民主和专制之间，隔着成千上万昏昏欲睡的人民。	<br><br>
同样，独裁者掌握了“找钱、分赃”的要诀之后也不可能从此高枕无忧。当多伊式的独裁者把经济搞糟到一定程度，除非有外援，否则独裁者用以支付给致胜联盟的“好处费”也逐渐失去来源。这时候，军队开始骚动，官僚集团也坐不住了，要么独裁政府被推翻，要么主动推动改革以扭转经济局面。	<br><br>
作为一个模型，此书也不是没有它的漏洞。比如，它对制度变革完全“经济人”的解释，排除了意识形态的和政治文化的因素；又比如，它解释共性的能力甚于解释差异――为什么独裁国家也会出现公共福利？为什么民主国家不同党派的政策取向会非常不同？再比如对一些关键观点，作者似乎是采取了例证法而没有提供更系统的论据……。不过，作为一本由专业学术书籍改编成的半学术书籍，严密可能本来就不是它最核心的追求。但是有一类指责倒是可以理直气壮：一本名叫《独裁者手册》的书，写着写着就写成了《民主颂》，读者可不可以要求退钱？	<br><br>
